# Sentiment Analysis on Rate My Professors Comments

* To predict the quality and difficulty scores assigned by students based on the text of their comments.
* Gathered data from multiple sources like, 
* * A **larger dataset from Dr. Hibo Je** at Tsinghua University.
* * Another **smaller dataset from Kaggle** containing reviews from the undergraduate Claremont Colleges.
* * And produced even more data by using **web scraping techniques using Selenium** to acquire additional data.
* Employed **word embeddings and GloVe embeddings** techniques for effective text representation and better model
performance.
* Here in **first approch used only one dataset from Dr.Hibo Je** in CVS format with basic RNN model for which we are able
to acquire only **35% approximatly for both Quality and difficulty**.
* Here in **second approch used combination of all three data** set with again only by using basic RNN model but here we are
able to **recive 75% approximatly for Quality and 69% for difficulty** which is siqnificant leap in improvment without
building the optimum model and adjusting hyperparameters.
