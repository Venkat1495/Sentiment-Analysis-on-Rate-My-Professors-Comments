 FHS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Professor Nichols is super nice and very wholesome! There is a lot of reading, but you can get by without doing very much of it. He does talk a LOT and doesn't foster as much discussion, but I think the latter might also be because people stop doing the readings a few weeks in. He does appreciate participation and gives great essay feedback!",James Nichols ,Government department
 RLST118,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof Humes is really knowledgeable, but her lectures aren't very clear and she often gets sidetracked. However, she's very willing to work with you outside of class. She allows little time for written exams, but she's flexible with deadlines if you just ask, and tries to thoroughly prepare students for such assignments, quizzes or research papers.",Cynthia Humes ,Religious Studies department
 ECON50,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,B-,Yes,"If you fall behind it's almost impossible to catch up. He's a nice guy, but he's a bit difficult to understand during lectures. Expect to do a lot of work on your own out of the textbook to get the concepts down and use his lectures to supplement AFTER you've already looked at the lesson. Not a horrid grader, but the policy was unclear & stressful.",Colin Wright ,Economics department
 ARTH2000,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Meyer is intensely brilliant and provokes thoughtful discussion, making tricky concepts fun to think about. Her class is deeply challenging, combining serious readings with weekly writings and asking students to critically analyze complex texts and images. You will succeed if you strive, and she'll make you want to strive. I recommend!",Ann Meyer ,Literature department
 FHS010,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,Would not recommend taking him for fhs or even govt. A lot of people said hes easy but hes not. Hes become a very hard grader. What was most annoying was that we never got any guidelines on papers. He told us to write about anything and gave no structure. Also he has a very weird grading system in which he uses points. very boring class.,Jay Martin ,Government department
 AST66,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"I took astro for my science GE, but ended up really enjoying it! Tom is a great teacher with a fabulous sense of humor. There's no HW besides studying for the 4 exams (all MC, challenging but fair) and the material is fascinating. There are only 5 labs, which are relatively quick/easy, but you CANNOT miss any. Would definitely recommend the class!",Thomas Dershem ,Physics department
 RLST143,5.0,2.0,,,A-,Yes,Great professor. Pretty interesting and not very difficult. Don't need to do any of the reading.,Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department
 PSYC109,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,Best professor Ive ever had at CMC. Anyone who disagrees just couldnt handle the heat she brings. Would be a waste of your education to not take Levinespecially if a Psych major and/or interested in statistics.,Shana Levin ,Psychology department
 MATH30,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,The best professor in my academic years student center activity was on of his delivery style,Mario Martelli ,Mathematics department
 PSYC30,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,I love her. She is corky for sure but thats what makes her engaging. The classes are very chill and there is almost no homework. Only things that are hard are her tests because she is very loose with teaching... But if you study a couple days before the test you will be fine.,Marjorie Charlop-Christy ,Psychology department
 HIST080,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Lofgren, aka, ""Chuckles,"" deepened my knowledge of U.S. History when I came to CMC in 1975. In those days, all professors lectured for the full duration of the class. But lecturing does not mean that students are being passive--no, I was actively taking notes while listening and thinking to what this brilliant scholar was saying.",Charles Lofgren ,Political Science department
 CHEM116,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I don't know why he has such poor reviews! Prof. Black made my ochem experience as pleasant as possible, he is so kind and caring and loves teaching the material. Gave us lots of practice problems so the exams were very very fair. I know ochem is hard but he was awesome and I really learned a lot with him, highly recommend.",Kersey Black ,Chemistry department
 ECON175,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Nothing but positive things to say about Prof A. She is amazing at giving feedback outside of class and will not judge you when you have the stupidest questions. She has a quirky sense of humor that makes her just even more fun to discuss with. Really cares about her students personally.,Heather Antecol ,Economics department
 GOV149,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"He literally expects that you have ALL the time in the world to finish the work for his class-as if other classes don't exist, or thesis, or job search, or jobs. He rants and doesn't explain what he wants. Awful. just awful. He is nice, but so it George W. Bush...didn't make him a great president, though. Never take his class if you can avoid it",Edward Haley ,Government department
 MATH030,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Do not take calculus with this professor. DO NOT. Especially if you are new to the subject and think you will need help. He is cold, unapproachable, and often gives you a hard time for asking a questions as if you are dumb. When he does answer questions its not in a clear, understandable way. Worst professor I have had for a small college",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,2.0,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,"If you want an easy A take him. His exams are pretty easy and you don't really have to do a lot of work. BUT he clearly shows no interest in teaching the class. He has that stuck up attitude ""Econ 50 is too easy for me to teach."" His office hours aren't helpful at all. He will give you that dirty look for asking to clarify something. ",Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department
 HIST109,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"excellent class, different, and interesting.",Reed Gratz ,History department
 FIN450,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,"It's a class of mostly seniors so she's pretty chill about assigned work and grading. The tests are hard to prepare for because she isn't really clear about what's going to be on it, but if you're thorough and do all the readings you'll do alright. The lectures are pretty long and arduous.",Janet Smith ,Economics department
 FWS,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"As a professor, she is insightful, a great educator and a discussion leader. After taking the class you'll realize the wisdom you have gained throughout the semester through reading and writing critically. This class takes quite a lot commitment but it's totally worth it.",Audrey Bilger ,Literature department
 MATH30,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Nice guy, but gets lost easily, often creates too tricky examples that even he can't work through. Homework can be on subjects not covered properly in class and at a level that has not been explained. Tests are not bad though. Out of 19 or so at the beginning less than half remained...",James Pinter-Lucke ,Mathematics department
 CHEM14L,4.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Hatcher-Skeers is a great professor, but does tend to go a little quickly at times. Although she is really friendly and nice outside of class, she does come off as intimidating and sometimes a little rude during lecture. Helpful during office hours.",Mary Hatcher-Skeers ,Chemistry department
 FHS10,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof. Rosenbaum's FHS class is about the intersection of eastern and western history and philosophy. The assigned readings involved a diverse range of primary sources and novels. Each writing assignment helped students reflect on one section of the class. He raises key points in class discussions, and is always happy to elaborate on them in office",Arthur Rosenbaum ,History department
 BIO44,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"First two mid terms can be quite challenging if you start studying 2 days before the test. If you start studying a week before the test, then you have nothing to worry about. Final exam is very easy compared to the mid terms.",Donald McFarlane ,Biology department
 BIO43,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Wonderful Professor! Helped me see Biology as number of interrelated interesting theories,instead of a bunch of random facts. Great lectures, really funny!",Robin Justice ,Biology department
 PHIL30,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"One of my favorite profs at cmc. Super easy class, not much reading, but is able to participate in discussion even if u didnt do the reading. Super chill guy",Jefferson Huang ,Philosophy department
 ECON86,3.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,The tests are hard but he is VERY GENEROUS with the curves. He is a very sweet man but can be a little boring but he makes such bad jokes that it's kinda funny. You get 4 pages of notes on each test and 12 pages of notes on final. He isn't the best prof but much much better than the other accounting profs so I recommend him ,Joshua Rosett ,Economics department
 CALC2,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"I always was one of those kids who ""just doesn't get math."" Prof Peterson changed that. During office hours she walked us through problems in the level of detail I needed providing alternative explanations. Her feedback and guidance during freshman year were invaluable in my later finance courses. If you put in the work she is a great resource.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department
 BIO44,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Preest is a nightmare.I had her for lab/class. She will ruin any interest you have in biology. I took Bio,considering it as a major, but after her class, I will be switching. She is inconsiderate and doesn't care about her students. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS/LAB WITH HER! It is not unusual to get a D on a lab report without any comments. Beware!",Marion Preest ,Biology department
 CORE2,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,This class was terrible. Prof EG seemed pretty knowledgeable but the class was so repetitive and disorganized. Also she grades things she disagrees with more harshly which is kind of dumb.,Gretchen Edwalds-Gilbert ,Biology department
 GOV125DC,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Dr. Spalding is a fantastic teacher - she's challenging, thoughtful, and a great person (she set up a ton of DC opportunities for our class & is more than willing to help with networking, even after you leave DC). It seems most students that don't like her do so bc of her politics (god forbid students should be exposed to a different viewpoint).",Elizabeth Spalding ,Government department
 AISS,2.5,3.0,,,,No,"Dr. Tang is just about the friendliest teacher ever and she is undoubtedly brilliant. Unfortunately, she is very difficult to understand, which makes the difficult material in AISS even harder to comprehend. She graciously spent lots of time in office hours going over the materials again. It is evident that she sincerely cares about her students.",Irene Tang ,Biology department
 LIT10,3.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"I was not as enamored of Bradley as many of my peers.  If you're already a strong writer, you'll do well in the class, but he didn't seem helpful for people who were struggling. He also allegedly mocked my class to other students. He is clearly very intelligent & the book selection was interested, but it was clear he did not want to teach Lit 10.",Adam Bradley ,Literature department
 GOVT126,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I LOVE prof Haskell! He's so funny, and while sometimes the class lacks structure, he's pretty good at answering questions so ask him about the things you don't feel clear on.",John Haskell ,Government department
 HIST125,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"I love Professor Yoo!  He is very nice, funny, and really loves what he is teaching about and seems to love his students.  His is easily my favorite class this semester.",David Yoo ,History department
 PSYC188,5.0,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,Professor Costanzo is one of the best professors I have had at CMC. He truly brings the topic to life in hands-on demonstrations and real-life scenarios. Truly a skilled professor. He is always asking for feedback and truly takes it into account. Take one of his classes!,Mark Costanzo ,Psychology department
 LEAD144,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"He's by far the best Professor at CMC. I have never met a person who has not been fascinated by him, and his classes are incredibly interesting. Easily my favorite class I've taken. Cannot stress enough how amazing this dude and class are. ",Jay Conger ,Psychology department
 MILS001,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Honestly, I think a class from Kirkland should be a requirement for Govt majors. All the information you learn is relevant, much of it you didn't know before (I didn't) even though it impacts your life in a big way, and it will continue to be relevant when you leave CMC. Many people in Govt don't know much about the military, and that's a shame.",Robert Kirkland ,History department
 PSYCH030,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Professor Halpern is very intelligent--and she knows it. She is fairly condescending and isn't very sensitive if you don't understand something. Her class is easy if you are good with memorization. Don't slack off because one bad test grade will come back to haunt you. A very interesting class.,Diane Halpern ,Psychology department
 FIN330,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Rather not say,Yes,The best professor I have had at CMC and an incredibly intelligent person.,Lisa Meulbroek ,Economics department
 GOV20,3.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"He is very enthusiastic about his subject, but I didn't really learn anything in his class that wasn't covered in AP Gov. He is a very interesting person and has great stories about working in government, but I wouldn't recommend him as a teacher. Your grade is completely based on arbitrary textbook terms.",Michael Uhlmann ,Government department
 LIT163,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"She is the best professor you could ever have, especially because she helps you become more driven and curious. The course material we read is intense but really interesting, we learn about different societies, and she gives great feedback. She is definitely not an easy grader, but I improved so much between my first written work and the last one.",Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department
 PSYCH040,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"No essays, so you won't 100% die, but do need to participate, read studies, and do forum posts. Grades rigidly and the syllabus makes him sound utterly scary and unforgiving, but he's nice guy. You'll pick up good study strategies as a side effect.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 RS174,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,Prof. Lejon is one of those rare professors that take the extra effort... He is extremely organized. He was of tremendous support. Take this class!,Kjell Lejon ,Government department
 LIT10,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"This was a great class. Pretty easy grader. Super chill, relaxed class. But you also actually learn a lot. Great, fair marker.",Eric Puchner ,English department
 BIO44,2.0,1.0,,,,No,"Compared to the other Bio 44 classes, this one is by far the easiest. If you have him for lab and lecture you are set for a good grade! Make sure to use his practice exams because he uses a lot of the previous year questions.",Dan Guthrie ,Biology department
 ECON102,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,"By far the worst professor I have ever had, not just in college but in my entire academic career. Not only is he unclear about what will be on the exams, he is misleading, saying certain topics will not be tested and then proceeding to test the class on them anyway. He is unapproachable, ridicules you when you ask questions. DO NOT take him.",Sven Arndt ,Economics department
 BIO43,5.0,4.0,,,A,Yes,"Wiley is a great teacher, incredibly enthusiastic, and someone you will want to do research with after her class. That being said, she is hard. Her tests employ applications of topics to completely new scenarios more than just regurgitations of information. Don't take her if you want to coast.",Emily Wiley ,Biology department
 PE110,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,,No,One of the best teachers out there. Has amazing stories and really knows what he's doing,David Hamilton ,Physical Education department
 SPAN102,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"Absolutely adore her. This is my 2nd time having her (SP44 last year). It's a hard class that requires dedication and critical thinking. Never a boring class with Martinez. She's hilarious. Make sure to take really good class notes;she won't write everything down, so listen,& ask if you need clarification or are confused:Very helpful for studying",Maria Martinez ,Modern Languages department
 PSYCH155,4.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Ethnic Minorities & Mental Health Psychology was hands down the highlight of my semester.  Prof Hwang served as a very knowledgable resource for our learning in a very important issue on our campus.  Discussion-based course, great readings, would highly recommend for anyone wanting to increase cultural competency, not just for psych majors.",Wei-Chin Hwang ,Psychology department
 ECON350,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,A-,Yes,"Bird's class was extremely difficult. He gives an insane amount of reading per week. His classes are confusing and feel as though you are being talked at versus a dialogue. No answer will satisfy him, he will always have something negative to say about it. He is a nice guy, but not a prof I would take again. I studied dayght to pull off that A-",Graham Bird ,Economics department
 BIOL148,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"She is very sweet and passionate about neuroscience. She sometimes mixes up terms in lecture, but she's quick to point out her own mistakes. Our online tests were open note, so they were a bit on the harder side, she's a nitpicky grader. Homework assignments were good ways to bring up my grade, and she's great at explaining dense research papers!",Melissa Coleman ,Biology department
 ECON160,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof Batta is amazing as a professor and person. He is always willing to help out over office hours and in things not class-related (introducing you to people, helping on research, or finding summer opportunities on your behalf). In Accounting Data Analytics we had to code in R for midterms, he will spot-check your code so you avoid syntax errors!",George Batta ,Economics department
 SPAN125B,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Wall is a professor of literature yet has a strong accent which could be both hilarious and very distracting/annoying. She is extremely inflexible in both assignments and communication and easily becomes passive aggressive in person and over email. I don't know how she does in language classes, but she is terrible at literature. Worst prof ever!",Catherine Wall ,Modern Languages department
 HUM3103,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,No,"I took Jasmine at Quest Univ, Canada and I can tell you that she is the greatest instructor ever.  Yeah you have to work hard but she works just as hard. On students' papers she writes pages of clear and helpful comments. Her brain seems full of info, like we all wondered how a head can contain that much. Her insights will blow your mind wide open.",Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department
 GENETICS,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Armstrong is THE professor to take at the Claremont Colleges. I had her for genetics and her enthusiasm is unparalleled!!! I never missed any of her classes because of how awesome she is, even though waking up so early is tough. Do whatever you can to take any of her classes, even if you have to change majors!",Jennifer Armstrong ,Biology department
 PHIL30,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"One of the best teachers that I've had at CMC! His lectures are very clear, detailed, and he uses many different examples to get the points across. He has great humor and is very helpful during office hours.  Also, the work load is very light and reasonable. I highly recommend him!",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department
 CS51,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,N/A,He is a good lecturer I took a Database course. He gave two mid-term exams and one final. lots of assignments and a group project. But the difficulty was fair enough.,Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department
 ECON102,4.5,3.0,,,,No,"Prof. Blomberg is a great guy to get to know. Always gives good partial credit on tests, and only 3 problem sets per semester, but challenging and engaging enough to make you think and keep you interested. Extremely helpful outside of class, and just a really nice guy in general. Best Macro prof at CMC for sure.",Brock Blomberg ,Economics department
 FHS10,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Honestly, don't worry about all of these reviews. Nita is not that hard and she has a great message that you can leave the class with: colonialism and orientalism colors every part of our society. I learned so much about the world and even though she lectures in tangents, it's an easy class and if you put in the work you will get a good grade.",Nita Kumar ,History department
 LIT10,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"I love Amy Leal!  Great, fun, friendly, caring, wonderful professor!  I wish she had never left the school!!!  She really encouraged me to improve my writing!",Amy Leal ,Literature department
 MATH118,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,don't know what the previous people are talking about. I had never done calc before this class but understood it because of her. do all the assigned homework and practice tests and you have an excellent chance of getting a good grade,Andrea Jedwab ,Mathematics department
 FHS10,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Prof Skinner is amazing! She is extremely passionate and very knowledgable in her field. Cares about students and provides good feedback. Class is fairly easy. She also makes really good apple sauce cake!,Lee Skinner ,Modern Languages department
 MATH31,2.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"There were a number of issues with this class, so I was excited when he asked us to give him tips on how to improve the class. The next class, he read all the ideas (many of which were repeated many times) and dismissed them as silly, or said he couldn't change things because we ""aren't a large graduate university."" There are better math profs here",David German ,Mathematics department
 ECON101,1.5,4.0,,,,No,"She's a nice person, but was largely unavailable for extra help when needed. Tests are not easy, although the problems are given in class, she doesn't give partial credit, so you can't make ANY errors or you will get a zero on the problem.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department
 BIO071,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"She has a structure to her lessons which is nice but she is subjective and vague about what she wants resulting in a bad grade because she hasn't specified what she wants (very harsh on lab reports--before her I never got below a B). Also, she can be very passive aggressive...and kind of spiteful. Not terribly an enjoyable class. Very stressful.",Amy Chow ,Biology department
 ECON50,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,You learn a lot about the happenings around you as well as whatever he covers from the textbook. Would take him again...,E Aksoy ,Economics department
 HIST161,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Park is one of the BEST professors I've learned from. Lectures are interesting, even if you're not that interested in Korean history but if you are, you're in for a real treat. Funny and light-hearted professor, super understanding. Lots of reading but learn to skim/get good bits and you're fine. Group projects are engaging and fun.",Albert Park ,History department
 ART7224,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"He is a great professor very kind easy to understand it is a hard course but if you read the book it's not as hard. The subject is very interesting, lots of notes are required and lots of study time for the final the study guides are long but simple if u just follow the book. The stuff he talks about in class is exactly the same as in the text.",Deepak Shimkhada ,Religion & Philosophy department
 ECON102,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I would definitely recommend taking a class with Professor Shelton at CMC. Although he may be difficult than other professors, you can really learn a lot if you put in the effort. He is incredibly knowledgeable in the political-economy realm and is easily accessible outside of class. Easily one of the best professors I have had.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department
 ECON139,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,Hughson is a really great and super intelligent man. I would say he's so smart that he forgets that we're students trying to learn the topic and sometimes assumes we just understand what he's saying. Read the class notes he provides and do the practice exams. The labs aren't too bad just give yourself enough time to do them.,Eric Hughson ,Economics department
 BIOL143,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"I came to class every day and agree w/ the poor review. I also went to office hours and he was still unclear. Karpel needs to work on his teaching, and that's that. Just because it's college doesn't mean you can't expect a decent prof, especially after dishing out fortunes of money. Maybe for some that doesn't matter.",Jonathan Karpel ,Biology department
 ECON134,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"um, take two steps back, amir ... way more touchy and flirty than any professor should be, in my opinion ...",Amir Barnea ,Economics department
 LIT78,3.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Jamaica is great to listen to, an amazing woman to hear speak, and provides a learning experience just by being present. My class was very unstructured, but also fascinating, though not primarily academically.",Jamaica Kincaid ,Literature department
 LIT145,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Keri is a kind, thoughtful, and disarmingly brilliant professor. She genuinely cares about her student?s success and is extremely personable. Highly recommended.",Keri Walsh ,Literature department
 LIT10,1.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"The book selection was great.  However, I did not find this professor very stimulating as a discussion leader.  She also randomly calls on people in class.",Katherine Noel ,Literature department
 PHIL101,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Birondo is a funny, quirky prof, but he is crystal clear and very passionate about his subject which makes his classes much more interesting.  If you're into philosophy you'll love him.",Noel Birondo ,Philosophy department
 GOVT141B,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"One of the best professors at CMC! Lots of reading (typically three 20-page articles daily, 120p/week), but he sends out questions before the class - so you know where to focus and where to skim. Lectures are AMAZING! He demystifies complex concepts and explains the causes behind econ and political trends. Plus, he has a great sense of humor!",Minxin Pei ,Government department
 SPAN44,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,I had professor Vega-Duran my first semester at CMC and immediately loved her. She moves through interesting material and includes conversation and class participation. She was also very helpful and understanding when I had to take an incomplete in her class.,Raquel Vega-Duran ,Modern Languages department
 LIT10,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,Really helped me improve my writing. I was a decent writer going into the class but I felt proud of what I was producing by the end. He is a really nice and sensitive guy and made a rather dull subject (Intro. College Writing) amazingly fun. Enjoyed the theme and genuinely felt getting better paper by paper. Reasonable grader and workload.,Ryan Carhart ,Literature department
 GOV70,3.0,3.0,,,,No,Kang is sometimes difficult to understand and makes a lot of awkward but hilarious comments. His class is largely discussion based and he really wants students form their own opinions and be PROVACATIVE. Definitely go talk to him in office hours before you start writing the final paper because the guidelines are pretty ambiguous.,Myung-Koo Kang ,Government department
 GOV122,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Do not take her. When she talks, it's only about her biography and rarely relevant to anything in class. The work assigned has absolutely nothing to do with what she says and very little to do with the class - be prepared to teach yourself everything. Only write conservatively or you'll get a bad grade. She's either right or you're wrong.",Constance Rossum ,Government department
 ECON1,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,Professor Bonaparte is an amazing professor cares about students and make the class very interesting... i recomend him.. wish he stays at CMC,Yosef Bonaparte ,Economics department
 CALC30,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"If you have never taken Calculus before, do NOT take this class. Professor O'Brien is purely concerned with his own graduate research, and really could care less about how you do in the class. He does not explain things well, and makes things that are easy complicated. DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS.",Michael O'Brien ,Mathematics department
 CHEMSTRY100,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,He trains his students to act as a scholar. Focus on student's ability to handle the lab properly dos and don'ts. He  raise students' ability  to pass level instead of please them by lowering  his standards. ,Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department
 BIO143,3.0,2.0,,,,No,"Very nice woman and class was pretty straightforward. The first test was really challenging (long test, not enough time) but the other two were more fair. I felt sometimes points were taken off tests very arbitrarily although they were answers/definitions straight from notes or the book.",Jessica Malisch ,Biology department
 FWS,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Woelfel is one of the best professors I've had at CMC so far in any subject. He is so clearly passionate and knowledgable in his field, and gives extensive feedback and advice. He is a tough grader but if you work hard and listen to his advice, you will become a better writer.",Craig Woelfel ,Literature department
 GOV60,5.0,4.0,,,,No,One of the best and more terrifying professors I have every had.  I learned more from him than from any other professor.,Harold Rood ,Government department
 GOV149,5.0,3.0,,,A,No,"She is truly amazing scholar, caring person and fair professor. She knows USFP, religion and particularly Islam well.",Pinar Tremblay ,Government department
 CHEM022,2.0,3.0,,,,Yes,You might just want to teach yourself chemistry. She doesn't explain well the lectures. All her lectures are based on the books notes and not her own. I hate that she expects everyone to pass and yet she doesn't have office hours whatsoever. ,Kayla Kaiser ,Chemistry department
 ECON134,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"He is so kind and really wants students to do well. During the pandemic he was really accessible, offering office hours 9-5 every day except during class. The class is all lectures so take notes. That being said participation is the difference between an A and a B. No joke it will come down to that 1 point so, talk! He grades very tough at the end!",Murat Binay ,Economics department
 PHIL164,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Such an amazing Prof. He is one of the smartest guys, and really challenges you. If he thinks your paper is 'good', he'll give you a check which is a B+. I think this makes you think outside the box and push yourself to really put time into each argument you write for class. Would 100% take him again. Learned so much and each class was so valuable.",Andrew Schroeder ,Philosophy department
 GOVT135,4.5,4.0,Yes,,,No,"The most amazing class I've ever taken. She makes you work for your grade and doesn't seem to really love giving As (A- is a triumph in her class), but her amazing, powerful teaching style will give you more than any A could. LOVE IT and was genuinely sad to see the semester end, only because of this class.",Kristin Fabbe ,Government department
 CS051,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"Worst professor I have ever had. Unless you come into this course with prior knowledge of CS you will fail. Does not teach material at all, anything I learned in this course was self-taught. Poor use of class time (who brings their kids to class??) and very unclear lectures and instructions. Take this class somewhere else or teach yourself online",Emily Navarro ,Computer Science department
 FWS010,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"McGrath is extremely helpful during office hours. His paper topics may seem complex at first, but he helps you talk through ideas and gives plenty of direction. Sometimes class discussions are dry, but the material gets more interesting as the semester goes on. Paying attention to his lectures comes in handy when writing papers. Take notes!",Brian McGrath ,Literature department

 LIT058,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,Leland is a genius and you'll definitely learn a lot from him but make sure to meet with him when writing a paper. He is a completely fair and tough grader which improved my writing ability immensely. He challenges you to think but doesn't assign much homework  just to read whatever book you're discussing and three essays. I highly recommend him.,Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department

 FWS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,"Very chill class. We just had to read an assigned reading (which ranged anywhere from 10-50 pages ) but they were always really interesting and fast reads. He grades super leniently and gives great feedback. We only have 3 essays this semester (the last one being our final). there is a participation grade, but discussion is usually pretty chill!",Evan Kindley ,Literature department
 CALC2,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Workload and tests are fair, lectures are straightforward and the notes are legible. Krumm's class was manageable, and he is very helpful during office hours, and even held review sessions before the midterms. I could tell that he cared about his students. Had a positive experience in his class. It's a pity that he's only a visiting assistant prof.",David Krumm ,Mathematics department
 HIST182,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Took history of human health and disease with Prof. Venit-Shelton and really learned a lot! Assigned a variety of projects rather than typical papers or tests based on readings which I loved and was very clear about grading. She is creative, enthusiastic, and SUPER kind to her students! She curated this topic so well and cared what we had to say.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department
 CHEM116L117L,5.0,2.0,,,Not_Sure_Yet,No,"In a subject as difficult as OChem, Iafe is awesome. This is my 2nd semester with him, and he is so understanding and relatable to students. Really just an amazing OChem professor. Would HIGHLY recommend.",Robert Iafe ,Chemistry department
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,"Worth getting to know her during office hours -- she's super helpful and knowledgeable, especially about technical things in econometrics/Stata/Tableau.

 BIO177,4.0,3.0,Yes,,B+,No,Prof Ngo was always helpful in office hours and he clearly wanted his students to learn biochemistry. The tests were fairly similar to the practice exams and the homeworks. The ridiculously expensive textbook really wasn't used for the class. I really enjoyed taking biochem with him though.,Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department
 CS55,1.0,1.0,Yes,No,C,Yes,She is terribly unclear.  Her lectures are fumbling.  Even worse she is very very bad and understanding questions.  I really expected more.,Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department
 ECON86,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,His class did not help me learn the material well and when I asked for help he did not care to provide it. He is not an easy professor because he does not teach the subject well and then tests you on it with a test he does not even read himself. Please do not take his class!,Douglas McEachern ,Accounting department
 CS040,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,No,Weekly homework. Two tests. Great person. Really cares that the students learn basic CS. There for you if you need him. Take his class!,John Sun ,Computer Science department
 ECON120,3.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"The class wasn't very enlightening and it was confusing at times. However, the workload was reasonable and the tests pushed you to think, which was good. While Yoon wasn't the best at explaining things, he was really nice and helpful.",Jungmo Yoon ,Economics department
 ARBC44,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,I'm in my second class with Ghenwa and she's amazing! She really encourages you to be your best and makes a difficult language fun and accessible.

 CHEM117,2.0,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Nice lady, terrible prof. Never responds to email and rarely shows at meetings. Talks too fast and doesn't explain her processes clearlycarefully. Expects you to show up to all problem sessions though optional.  Wish she was more helpful. ",Gretchen Stanton ,Chemistry department
 LIT097,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Her class was the best I've taken at college.  She knows a *lot* and the class was consistently taught at a high level.  She also struck an excellent balance in class discussion.  Her feedback always brought up new ideas I hadn't considered.  Would 100% recommend if you are passionate about the subject, but if you aren't give it a miss.",Kathryn Stergiopoulos ,Literature department
 PSYC150,2.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,She is somewhat new to teaching. She apparently thought it was a great idea to test us on 15 chapters with no study guide. She was nice enough to curve the exam but the curve was set by 1 of the 3 grad students in a class of 25. Her lectures were very vague and studying for the 2 exams was difficult because the students were not given any direction,Lindsey Sterling ,Psychology department
 LIT065,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I'd like to note that Giulio remains the best professor I've ever had. Not only is Giulio personable and incredibly supportive, he is brilliant!.

I wish he was still here because his classes were inspirational and the highlight of my educational experience.",Giulio Pertile ,Literature department
 ECON149,3.0,1.0,Yes,No,A,Yes,"Professor Bergevin is a very kind and encouraging professor, but he doesn't seem that enthusiastic about the subject material.

 GOV020,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof Rose is incredibly organized, knowledgeable and engaging. Her classes are well structured and she prints off the slides for you. There are no midterms, but rather pop quizzes on important topics. She is a fair grader. As long as you work hard and show that you are engaged, Gov20 is extremely worthwhile to take with Rose.",Shanna Rose ,Government department
 MATH166,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Homework was a bit tough for me since I wasn't very skilled with programming in matlab before taking his course, but he provides many resources and is very helpful in office hours (usually walks you through it). Lots of review in the first week(s) so everyone is caught up. Test content is gone over clearly in class (1 question on x, 1 on y, etc.)",Blake Hunter ,Mathematics department
 HIST111,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Hopper's class was demanding but equally rewarding. He has very high expectations for his students, most obviously shown in the way he grades. But his discussions never failed to be engaging and thought-provoking. Would definitely take his class again.",Ian Hopper ,History department
 CHEM14,4.5,2.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,"Professor Rinaldi is one of the kindest professors. She does a great job at being available, and is very flexible with office hours if you make an effort to email her. Weekly homework that takes about an hour (sapling), and class participation (REEF). There are 3 midterms and a final. The book (and outlining) is ESSENTIAL. Class slides are helpful.",Airlie Rinaldi ,Chemistry department

 CHEM15,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"There are daily quizzes, which means you can't miss a single class. He really wants his students to succeed and is open with questions + OHs. Generally clear lectures, but I wish he had gone more in-depth and did more calculations because I felt the exams didn't always reflect what was learned in class. Overall, solid choice for chem 14/15!",Cameron Iverson ,Chemistry department
 BIO43,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,This was a difficult class and Prof Cohen made us really work for the A but he is a great professor. He is clear about his expectations and he genuinely wants us to do well. He tries to accommodate us for office hours so he is very accessible. He explained concepts really well and I would take class with him again if he hadn't left!,Joseph Cohen ,Biology department
 ECON125,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Prof Vossmeyer is the best tbh. Very nice and explains topics very well. If you pay attention in class and go to office hours (if needed) you should get at least a B+. I was scared of metrics before the class but it ended up being a breeze. Super chill class and you learn a lot,Angela Vossmeyer ,Economics department
 PHYS30,2.5,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,"He came from a large school (UCSB) and his attitude toward us showed it. Was very condescending. There were little to no mentions of biology in a PHYSICS FOR LIFE SCIENCES class - maybe he has never taken biology. He is enthusiastic, which helped, but it was not enough to make this class bearable. This is the worst class I've ever taken at the 5Cs.",Kevin Moore ,Physics department
 HIST132,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof Lower knows her stuff, and she is super caring. It's a really interesting class, and just has a lot of weekly readings. The one thing I don't like is that it is kind of disorganized at times, but besides that really is quite an enjoyable class. For a seminar class, time goes by fast! Would def take again. Overall, Lower is great and do take.",Wendy Lower ,History department
 FHS10,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Nicest professor I have ever had, totally worth taking his class.",Glen Cooper ,History department
 FWS10,4.5,1.0,Yes,,,No,"He's new so he comes off as a pushover and doesn't really know how to lead a discussion yet, but really really helpful at office hours. He genuinely WANTS you to do well in the class so lets you rewrite all 3 of your papers. Loves when you participate so do it! It doesn't count for your grade but it'll make the class go faster!",Seth Anderson ,Literature department
 CHEM1A,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,B-,Yes,"Very unprofessional and mediocre, (she most likely erased more of the negative reviews). Don't rely on her help or she will intimidate you by replying that you didn't pay close enough attention etc, instead of just answering the simple question. She looses focus in classes and goes off topic, shes rude online and in person. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",Arlie Rinaldi ,Chemistry department
 ARBC33,3.0,2.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Low expectations mean it's up to the students to take initiative in learning material by reading and writing outside of class. A grammar-heavy curriculum can be frustrating. That said, I haven't encountered a more caring, friendly, and self-reflective professor at CMC. He's a gem. His classes are easy but don't expect to master Arabic anytime soon.",Muhammad Habib ,Modern Languages department
 CHEM116,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof. Hurlocker is awesome. Her o chem classes are tough, like probably the hardest class I've ever taken. But she is the best lecturer I have ever had, and she gives you all the tools to succeed, you just need to work for it. Super accessible in office hours, and if you are confused on anything and ask her to explain it, she does it perfectly.",Brisa Hurlocker ,Chemistry department
 GOV20,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,"Pears is the perfect Gov professor to take if you are an international student or don't know anything about American Politics. Her classes are mostly lecture and discussion based, but will sometimes throw in a cool activity. She is a normal grader- leaning more towards tough than lenient. There is a lot of reading so be prepared for that.",Emily Pears ,Government department
 PHIL20,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Literally my favorite class this semester. If you actually participate it can be hilarious, inspirational and awesome. Pretty good guy, but tough grader so just go meet with him. Would 100% take again.",Gregory Antill ,Philosophy department

 NEURO1,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"The class was overall very interesting, however, she was not very good at explaining things in class and her tests were extremely hard. She gives a ton of homework outside of class and expects you to turn in grad student level work. Would not reccomend.",Audrey Chen ,Biology department
 EA30,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Class was pretty straight forward since a lot of non-science majors are in it. He's very caring and understanding, will know everyone's name. Heard he's a little tough with grading labs, but I did 't find that to be true for my group. Tests are pretty straightforward and information is taken from lectures.",David Smith ,Biology department
 CSCI055,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Shaar is fantastic. He is one of the most caring and inspirational professors at the school. He is clearly passionate about what he teaches, and his enthusiasm is easily transferred to the students. You can tell that Shaar really cares about everyone in the class, and he really wants everyone to succeed. Couldn't recommend him more.",Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department
 LEAD10,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Gave a 1 because the system doesn't allow for 0. Absolutely horrible as a professor: doesn't know her stuff, easily loses track of her teaching in class (multiple times over a semester), does zero prep for classes and let the students self-study and teach, no clear grading guidelines and very defensive when asked about her comments. Never take her!",Sara Thompson ,Leadership department
 BIO171,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,A-,No,This professor was vague about grading and spent too much time talking about horses!,Anastasia Nagel ,Biology department
 HIST059,2.0,5.0,Yes,,B,Yes,"You can tell she has spent hundreds of hours setting up the structure of the class, making it very stressful on our end. We spend a lot of hours each week writing and working on reading responses. If you are just trying to get a GE fulfilled DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS. There is a more than 40 double spaces written throughout the semester...for a GE",Chelsea Wang ,History department
 RLST166B,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I've learned more from him than any other professor in college. He makes you work, but you will feel like you actually learned something useful. He teaches you skills you will never forget. Mans is so smart. You won't regret his class.",Justin Doran ,Religious Studies department
 BIO44,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Gilbert is a pretty chill individual. Her lectures might be a bit dense but nothing you can't handle. There is literally no homework but the exams are pretty though so if you study enough, this class should be a breeze",Princess Gilbert ,Biology department
 ECON102,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Extremely difficult class. He's new and it seems he was hired for research, not for teaching, because he does not know how to lecture. You will self teach yourself everything, and it will most likely not be enough, because his exams are all questions you have never seen before. Unless you love pain and suffering stay away from this class.",Matt Delventhal ,Economics department
 BIOL141,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,"She's so mean! Racicot is not friendly or helpful in or outside of class. She contradicts herself all the time, and her grading isn't clear. She is vague, and seems really unconfident in her field. All this combined with her poor attitude doesn't make for a very good experience.",Rachel Racicot ,Biology department
 ECON125,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Gillen's ECON125 was a hard class but he made it bearable, his tests are hard but he averages them out and wants to make sure you actually learn the material. Don't worry about the grade that much as he curves most his tests to a B+/A- average. The median grade from my year was an A- I believe.",Benjamin Gillen ,Economics department
 FWS010,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Professor Wyman was kind and very understanding. The course was easy but interesting if you're like reading or creative writing. I would highly recommend taking her FWS class.,Annie Wyman ,Literature department
 CSCI181,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"I enjoyed Prof. Naumov's game theory course, though the topics were a little scattered. He was helpful during office hours wrt the homework. However, exams were definitely much harder than the homework assigned and problems discussed in class. He usually made up for this by providing opportunities for extra credit. Overall, a good professor.",Pavel Naumov ,Computer Science department
 HIST117,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,"Horrible professor! Professor Sarzynski doesn't know how to teach. Her grading isn't straight forward nor does she teach anything of use.

 MATH032,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof. Wong is the BEST! She makes me want to major in math. She was always accessible and willing to help outside of class. The exams were difficult but with practice and the notecard you can have, it is manageable. Quizzes were hard. Homework is graded on completion. Very understanding and caring prof. I would 100% recommend her!!!!",Helen Wong ,Mathematics department
 ARBC140,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Thomas sparked my passion for learning Arabic. While her predecessor had strictly followed the lessons in the book, Professor Thomas brought her own materials in the classroom, encouraging us to feel more comfortable speaking. Her liveliness gave me confidence in my ability to learn the language and now, as a Fulbright ETA I continue!",Marie Claude Thomas ,Modern Languages department
 FWS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"prof Basu is my favorite professor ever. She is extremely smart, hilarious, super understanding. She facilitates class discussions very well.

 GOVT149,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Prof. Favretto's class is so interesting and engaging. She teaches with full knowledge and usually connects her topics to current events. I loved attending her classes because it was so straightforward and interesting. She is also an easy grader and grades based on participation (you can just go to office hours instead), 2 tests and a final paper.",Katja Favretto ,Government department
 ECON86,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Taylor truly cares about his students. He made himself readily available outside of class to answer any questions and was very helpful in these sessions. The course is very reading heavy, and using the SmartBook function on MH Connect is key to learn the the material. The exams and quizzes were straightforward for the most part.",James Taylor ,Accounting department
 BIOL131,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"This prof is kind and has good intentions. The homework load is pretty manageable aside from the occasional long textbook readings. Class time was stressful because of how much info he would try to cram in, and it felt rushed. Lab was easy and never took long. I learned a lot.",Jason Borchert ,Biology department
 GOV112,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Thomas is a very brilliant guy who will challenge you to think hard and defend your views. You will read and write a ton in his classes, but you will also become a better student because of it. Still, I probably wouldn't take his class if you aren't interested in the subject matter. He has high expectations for students, so be prepared.",George Thomas ,Government department
 ECON173,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Prof. Flory really cares about his students and will make time to meet with you outside of class and office hours.

 HIST111,2.0,4.0,Yes,,A-,N/A,"Prof. Petropoulos is very knowledgeable about WWII. Lots of readings and memorization, but it is manageable.

Reason for not taking him again: he can definitely do better in tolerating political views that don't necessarily champion democracy, and he talks often takes up half the class to talk about current global situations.

",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department
 ECON151,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I'm honestly amazed at how well-produced his lecture videos are. They are clear, informative, and include plenty of examples. He definitely makes you work for your grade-3 exams, 2 papers, and 20 or so homework quizzes, but by the end, you will have a strong grasp of managerial accounting.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department
 GOV112B,4.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Pay attention in class when he goes through the cases and will do well. 1 paper, a midterm, a final, and two case presentations. Doesn't grade very difficultly as long as put in the work and study well for exams",Ralph Rossum ,Government department
 ECON187,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"One of my favorite classes and professors at CMC. It's helpful to take Statistics or Metrics before enrolling in this class, but Professor Bjerk does a great job explaining the material clearly and thoroughly. I loved how we learned through relevant Economic papers. Everything felt very applicable.",David Bjerk ,Economics department
 PSYC37,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Day is a funny guy who cares about his students. The class material is really straight forward, but you won't do well on the quizzes and papers if you don't do the readings or show up to class.",David Day ,Psychology department

 FHS010,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I would really recommend taking a course with Prof. Espinosa if you are very interested in the course content - there's a lot of reading and writing.

He does take a while with grading, which can be rough.",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department

 GOV116,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,Prof Sinclair is super sweet and understanding - he made an assignment optional when everyone was stressing out about midterms. He gives pretty good feedback and always has something interesting to say. Definitely would take a class with him again!,Andrew Sinclair ,Government department
 ECON102,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Madison's macro class is difficult, but rewarding. For those less comfortable with derivatives it may not be a good choice, as it is math heavy.

 ECON50,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof. Ozbekilk is super nice and a good teacher. His online classes are mainly lectures, but he tries to get the class involved by asking us questions and playing games.

Quiz every week, midterm, test, homework.",Serkan Ozbeklik ,Economics department
 FHS060,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I had him for FHS Religion and Modernity and for a student who was not very interested in studying religion, the course topics really stuck with me long after that semester. The readings are hard to get through since they are archaic, yet the conversations during class made the reading make sense and he really wanted us to understand the content.",Daniel Michon ,Religious Studies department
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Took Professor Lincoln for Econ 101 and it was hands down one of my favorite classes I've taken so far.

Also just a really nice easygoing person to be around!,William Lincoln ,Economics department
 GOV20,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A-,N/A,"He makes boring topics interesting. Graded on a few essays, take home midterm, and final. He is so nice and very accessible outside of class. Easy grader but you learn the material very well. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",Charles Kesler ,Government department
 MATH032,3.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Easily one of the coolest professors at CMC. Lectures are given to the students and class time became office hours. Typical math exams turned into essay exams, which he might continue doing when we get back on campus. Didn't really retain any material but a fun class for math GE",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 GOV105,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Good professor, a little eclectic but super nice and caring guy. Tends to ramble but appreciates participation.

 FIN440,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,No,"While very smart - he fails to understand why students do not understand the material. He frequently says ""it's easy, isn't it"" when it is not easy at all. Students are lost in class and have to scramble for exams. He is a nice man but gives tough lectures.",Fan Yu ,Accounting department
 FWS010,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,Prof. Martinez is the worst professor that I have had during my time at CMC and sent me into an existential crisis on multiple occasions. She taught less than half of the class (electing to call the CWPD consultant or guest speakers to talk to us or just playing a video). She does not teach and does not even understand her own schedule.,Mellissa Martinez ,Literature department
 ECON050,4.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,C+,Yes,Evans is your best choice for Econ50. She's brilliant at teaching the concepts but needs to work on clarifying the applications of the material. 3 tests made up 60% of the grade - they were fast and difficult. Her class will set you up well if you want to major in econ. Attendance isn't taken but you need to go to do well. Go to her office hours!!,Mary Evans ,Economics department
 HIST55,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Professor Ferguson is so accommodating, supportive and understanding.

 PHIL183,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,"Take a class taught by Dr. B NEOW!!! She is such an amazing professor and will push you to think in new and different ways.

When the Claremont cold was going around, she wrote some common vitamin c supplements on the board and told us to try to get them so we don't miss class. She is really helpful during office hours, and she is easily approachable after class.",Minju Kim ,Modern Languages department
 CHEM116,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof Williams was a bit iffy at the beginning of the semester, but upped her game by week 3. She was EXTREMELY accessible in office hours and 1:1 meetings, and expects you to take advantage of that. Those who struggled in the class likely neglected this aspect of the course. Go to office hours! Good professor, even better person.",Sierra Williams ,Chemistry department
 ECON086,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,"Professor Massoud is great if you are confident in your knowledge of accounting. He is incredibly knowledgeable; however, the environment in his class became very toxic towards the end of the semester. He would often point out students he did not believe were doing well or putting in enough work, and he would openly lambast students in office hours",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department
 RLST156,1.0,3.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,Does not care about your time or money. ALWAYS LATE to class and her lectures were not always well-planned.

 RLST064,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I was initially intimidated by Professor Velji but he's incredibly caring and passionate. He brought us donuts after our mid-term, let us take a mid-class break to get chocolate-covered strawberries, and relaxed our first paper deadline during COVID. Very articulate to an extent that's sometimes hard to follow, but he's very open to questions.",Jamel Velji ,Religious Studies department
 37,2.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Professor Riggio is a very approachable and caring professor who also obviously enjoys the subject he teaches. However, the lectures do lack structure and sometimes just escalates into rambling--difficult to pay attention to. The grading criteria also isn't the most transparent. ",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department

 LIT165,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof. Shelton is obviously so intelligent and passionate - that being said, she did not handle the transition to online learning that well. I feel for her, because her lecture style is really well suited to in-person instruction. I definitely learned a lot in this class, but I fell off towards the end in terms of motivation to stay engaged.",Marie-Denise Shelton ,Modern Languages department
 GOVT060,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"if you are able to have Rod as a professor at some point in your college career you are LUCKY.

 ECON165,3.5,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Professor Filson is a bit of a stickler when it comes to grading, but the coursework is interesting and he teaches it well. Tests are easy if you study, it is mostly memorization. 3 midterms and 1 paper.",Darren Filson ,Economics department
 FREN2,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"I took French 1 & 2 with Sylvie. She was an incredible teacher and gave good but interesting lectures with a lot of group work in class. I was very disappointed when she didn't return this fall. She's a great language teacher, but be prepared to do a fair amount of work, daily, weekly, and big projects. Easy to do OK, very hard to get an A.",Sylvie Young ,Modern Languages department
 CHEM116,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"He's super brilliant, passionate, and helpful.",Adam Johns ,Chemistry department
 CHEM042L,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Took IBC with Sanii and really enjoyed him. I have literally never seen him in a bad mood, even when classes went online due to pandemic. It's a super hard class but he holds recitation sessions, office hours, and always posts his lecture notes online. He will NEVER make you feel dumb, and cares so much about his students. Hard class but worth it!",Babak Sanii ,Chemistry department
 BIOL44,3.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"This was my first college bio class and it was very different than I thought it would be. She lectured a lot but also made us do these partner projects that I felt were a waste of time. 3 midterms (MC and short answer on articles we read for HW), 1 final, 15 in-class quizzes (so you HAVE to show up everyday), and some short assignments. Nice woman",Roberta Engel ,Biology department
 FWS10,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Henri Cole is not only an amazing poet, but also a great Professor. His classes are only once a week and for 3 hours, but the time flies by as you discuss poetry and hear about his opinions on life. My own writing ability also drastically improved after taking his class. I highly recommend.",Henri Cole ,Literature department
 ECON052,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"As my first econ class, I got exactly what I expected: Lecture heavy intro course. Solid lectures, cracks up the class, but it's super easy to fall behind if you miss a class or two. Textbook is followed to an extent but lecture notes are super helpful. Flexible on due dates/gives extensions.",Meric Keskinel ,Economics department

 RLST010,4.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Awesome lady who's very knowledgeable about the subject matter, but expects a lot of her students. As someone who took this course to fulfill a GE, I was disappointed by the amount of time it required. If you're genuinely interested in Religious Studies, you'll have a blast!

 ECON101,5.0,1.0,Yes,,,No,Wright is right  :),Colin Wright ,Economics department
 DANTE1,5.0,5.0,,,,No,"Prof Meyer is a very eccentric prof, no doubt about it. She is also very serious about lit, so if you take her class take it seriously. And if you like Dante, you must take her class. I personally was reluctant to take Dante, but she opens your eyes to his brilliance. One of the hardest and most stimulating lit classes I took at CMC.",Ann Meyer ,Literature department
 FHS010,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A+,No,"Get ready to write a one-page essay every week exploring one of the various different humanities subjects you will be exposed to in this class.

(Also, take him if you want an easy-A FHS class.)",Jay Martin ,Government department
 ASTR066,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,B+,No,"Although I do think he was very nice and approachable, his lecture style was very convoluted and hard to follow.

Overall, wouldn't recommend it if you're planning on taking it for your science requirement - was not an easy class at all",Thomas Dershem ,Physics department
 PHIL040,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Really fascinating class and professor.  He's super smart.  Very much a lecture, but he does ask for your ideas and opinions and really likes it when you speak up.  He's very thorough and works hard to present all sides without bias.  The tests and essays are hard- I recommend talking to him in his office hours beforehand.",Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department

 CHEM116,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Professor Black is by far the worst professor I have had during my college trajectory. This class is taught in the following way: students are expected to read the textbook, and in class the professor does not lecture/substantiate on the readings, but rather does practice problems- not an effective method of teaching. Highly do not recommend Prof.",Kersey Black ,Chemistry department
 ECON175,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,"not very kind, snarky, plays favorites",Heather Antecol ,Economics department
 USISR1,1.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Haley is an awful professor who began every class with a tangent that no one could follow. The books were interesting but he can't at fostering discussion, fails to make the material accessible, and speaks for about 2/3 of the time. This class is hard--because you are constantly trying to guess the exact phrasing of exactly what he wants to hear.",Edward Haley ,Government department
 MATH111,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,B-,No,"He is the worse professor I've ever met in CMC. Unclear in class lectures. Unhelpful homework, especially mean to student during office hours. If there is an alternative to his DifQ, take the other ones.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,4.5,1.0,,,,No,"He's great! He makes a lot of jokes and is incredibly straightforward. If you can do the practice exam, you can do the actual exam. Really knows his stuff, and helps connect the material to the real world",Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department

 FIN450,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Janet Smith is one of the finest professors at CMC. She throws the kitchen sink at you in terms of resources (textbook, PowerPoints, practice problems & solutions) that enable you succeed in her course. Her lectures are very focused. She is an extremely pleasant person and I learned a great deal about valuation of new ventures in her course.",Janet Smith ,Economics department

 CHEM14,5.0,5.0,,,Rather_Not_Say,Yes,Very good at explaining the material and makes sure you get it. Classes are very fast (rushes through topics) and very packed with material (covers a lot of topics in one class). Exams are relatively hard but nothing you can't handle if you've done the reading and come to class. Would recommend her class if you don't mind the hard work.,Mary Hatcher-Skeers ,Chemistry department
 HIST163,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Rosenbaum has fine-tuned this class over many decades. He enjoys discussions with his students, both inside and outside the classroom. I felt inspired by the discussions and arguments that he raised. Students have a say in the topics that are discussed after the initial part of the course. This is a rewarding class for engaging students.",Arthur Rosenbaum ,History department
 BIO176,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"His lectures are really thorough and interestinghe doesn't take attendance but you shouldn't miss them. I found his ecology elective a lot more engaging than the intro 44 class; in fact, I'd say tropical ecology was one of my top 5 favorite classes in college and I'm not even a STEM major or pre-med student. No lab.",Donald McFarlane ,Biology department
 BIO43,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"She has a great attitude and wants all of her students to thrive. Short quizzes once a week, but they help you grasp the basic concepts and prepare before the test pops up.

 PHIL30,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Huang is a great professor who really understands ""ancient"" and ""modern"" philosophy. He also has great discussions on ethics and technology, and is a very applicable class. Because of him I am looking forward to taking more philosophy classes.",Jefferson Huang ,Philosophy department
 ECON86,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Rosett is so nice and is always cracking jokes. Lectures get boring but it's necessary to go to class to show you're putting effort into the class. He requires a lot of memorization of very small details but he has 5 tests which breaks up the information into smaller chunks. Homework is not graded and test curves are generous.,Joshua Rosett ,Economics department
 CALC30,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"The worst teacher I have ever encountered. Homework was rarely covered in class and tests were tough. If you have never taken calculus before, avoid at all possible costs. Lectures are boring and she'll constantly get through explaining a topic before going back on everything, realizing she did it wrong.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department
 BIO132L,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Preest is not bubbly, but she is extremely caring. Expectations are high but extremely clear. Labs are fun (you get to play with a lot of animals) but to succeed on lab reports you must spend a lot of time meeting with her for guidance (and if, god forbid, you hurt an animal, you should probably run and never come back). Highly recommended class!",Marion Preest ,Biology department
 BIO170,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"She's super passionate and explains everything well.  If someone is confused, she can easily come up with other explanations/analogies. Prof E-G is also one of the most adorable people ever.",Gretchen Edwalds-Gilbert ,Biology department

 HIST100,4.5,2.0,,,,No,"This was my favorite class this semester! met once a week, and sometimes Yoo would let us out early. one test which was easy and a book per week. one paper 15-20 pages which was worth 55% of your grade, if you're not a good writer 4get the class. Take this class if you want an easy grade. Yoo is very laid back. students led class discussions",David Yoo ,History department

 PSYCH141,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"The class is GREAT, the professor so-so. His reviews all remarked how preferential he is towards males, which is tough in a participation-heavy class, and we struggled with his lack of clarity of assignments (and making 60% of our grade due the week after thesis!). That being said, the class is AMAZING, one of the very best, just be prepared!",Jay Conger ,Psychology department
 HIST130,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Class was awesome!  I loved it. We went in depth about topics (NOT wars and stuff).. why war crimes? does army change you? recruitment?  great topics.  There is a lot of reading because you NEED to talk as this is a seminar.  1, 5 page paper a week too!  so it's a lot of work and you need to participate. harder than i thought",Robert Kirkland ,History department

 ECON134,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"One of the best professors across the Claremont Colleges. Lectures are intensely engaging.

 GOV20,2.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"After taking a few more classes at CMC, I discovered that Uhlmann is the worst teacher I've had at the 5Cs. If you are a liberal, DO NOT try to speak your mind or challenge him. He is a very staunch republican and very set in his opinions. He does know historical facts, however, he oftern presents them in an offensive way. DO NOT take for a GE.",Michael Uhlmann ,Government department
 FHS010,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,"Do not take Prof. Aitel's class. Incredibly difficult grader on papers even after meeting with her for help on papers multiple times and with the CWPD.

Stay away!!!!",Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department

 BIO44L,3.0,1.0,,,,No,"Guthrie is hilarious! You should get a good grade if you come to class and listen. He often recycles questions from old exams, and usually in his review sessions emphasizes things that won't actually be on the exam. Don't bother buying the book, all of his questions will be straight from lecture. Easy and fun to be in class!",Dan Guthrie ,Biology department
 ECON102,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,No,Hands down the worst professor I have had. He's extremely unclear in what he  expects from the class - making midterms and exams very hard to prepare for. Don't let his humorous persona fool you - get out while you can!,Sven Arndt ,Economics department

 ECON140,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Great professor but you'll definitely have to do the work outside of the course. He expects that, as a college student, he doesn't have to hold your hand through the course and that you'll do the readings and come to class prepared. I learned a ton and he's hilarious and I will definitely visit CMC to catch up with him again.",Graham Bird ,Economics department
 BIOL80,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Coleman is a wonderful professor, and makes the class extremely fun and interesting. The tests were also interesting though. They always felt really easy, but it did seem like she would take off points just to get you down to a certain grade. It was almost like your grade was predetermined. Besides for that, great class and fun professor",Melissa Coleman ,Biology department
 ECON154,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Batta is easily one of the most well-versed academics within the Robert Day School.

 SPAN01,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Wall is a great professor if you already have previous knowledge of spanish 1.  She is very accessible and encourages people to come for extra help.

 CIV10,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"I am sitting here with a friend who went to USC and had this prof too and we both thought she was so great. I took her for a GE course that other profs teach too.

 BIO143,4.5,1.0,,,,No,"Armstrong is fantastic.  I completely disagree with the other criticisms; in Bio 43 I never once opened the text book because everything I needed to know was in the lecture notes. She is a great lecturer and very straight forward with what you need to know.  If you go to the book for studying instead of notes, you'll only confuse yourself.",Jennifer Armstrong ,Biology department
 PHIL030,2.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"The worst prof that I have had at CMC so far. Test and practice questions are completely different. Chooses grades based upon his own views of arguments, and will refuse to agree with other students' views in class even when his is clearly the weaker point. If you are stuck taking him, make sure you write about only what he wants to hear.",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department
 CS62,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Somewhat intimidating and his lectures can be a bit awkward if nobody participates, but overall a great prof if you pay attention and do the homework. Don't procrastinate on CS homework, but if the whole class does, there's a high chance everyone will get an extension. His voice is pretty chill.",Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department

 HIST167,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"She can be a bit disorganized, and her response rate to emails varies wildly. She also is very set in what she wants, despite not the most clear about her expectations.

 LIT099,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"One of my all-time favorite teachers... she really makes writing fun.

Her assignments are off-beat and required presentations are challenging.  One of the easy fun classes that will REALLY improve your writing",Amy Leal ,Literature department

He teaches the core content of each class right away and then spends the rest of the class on examples, which is an easy way to learn calc. some of the prob sets were hard, but all were manageable and tests arent hard if you study a reasonable amount. gives partial credit. if math isnt your thing, i recommend him for the GE!",David German ,Mathematics department
 ECON173,4.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"Not sure where all the negative comments are coming from, everyone I know in her class loved her, she's funny in class, teaches very interesting material, her grading on tests was a little random, but I thought in the end with her emphasis on homework it all worked out well.  Really works to get to know the students, definitely take her class.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department
 BIO43,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,Horrible class.She doesn't curve at all when the majority of the class is clearly not doing well.For our first exam the average was in the 60's and she gave out F's and sent out low grade reports.Her lectures are very scattered and she was unable to answer any question posed to her by the students.Her exams are very hard & unfair.AVOID at all costs,Amy Chow ,Biology department
 ECON50,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,Professor Aksoy is the best Professor I have had at CMC. He is unbelievably knowledgeable on the subject and will apply economic principles to a variety of stories he will tell. Class is not mandatory but its interesting and he is very passionate about teaching. As long as you study for the tests they are straightforward. Highly recommended Prof.,E Aksoy ,Economics department
 HIST059,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,Professor is very unclear about his grading criteria and what he is looking for in assignments.

His readings are all very random and I barely learned anything in this class.,Albert Park ,History department
 ART11,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"This course is the same section, but taught at Chaffey College. One of the absolute worst Art History teachers I have EVER had. Taught like it was a graduate level course.

 ECON102,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof Shelton is the most dedicated, kind, helpful professor at CMC, imo. He's notoriously difficult, but you can handle it if you take good notes and put effort into problem sets. Follow his studying instructions and you'll do well on exams. Great in office hours.

 LIT099,2.5,2.0,,,,No,"I took a creative writing class with her. She is a wonderful, at times nutty woman.  Her lectures (often meandering stories with value) are wholly worthwhile. If you aren't drawn to writing or intent on developing your own voice, this isn't the class for you.",Jamaica Kincaid ,Literature department
 LIT10,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"She gives a lot of reading but they are intereand for the most part entertaining. Participation is a major grade in her class, so attendence is mandatory.

My writing increased a lot with her help.",Katherine Noel ,Literature department
 GOV141B,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Liked to cold call students during lecture so it was almost like a discussion but not really.

 SPAN44,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"You don't have to do a lot of work to pass.  44 is not really a literature class... you do a lot of reading, but it's not very difficult analysis.

 FWSEPIC,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"he is awesome. took his epic heroes class- great material, teaches it well and in depth, makes it interesting, makes it fun, makes it funny, and not too much work, especially for a writing class. you will truly be missing out if you don't take this class. best class i have taken all year",Craig Woelfel ,Literature department
 INTROTOIR,4.5,1.0,,,A-,No,she writes the best letters of recommendation. I am sad she is no longer at CMC but deeply caring about former students. Well connected,Pinar Tremblay ,Government department
 CHEM15,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"She's really kind and willing to help her students. I truly believe that she is a great person, but not necessarily the best teacher. I scored really poorly on her exams despite knowing the material pretty well because she expected us to know too many practical applications that we never went over. I'm much better at just cranking problems out.",Kayla Kaiser ,Chemistry department
 ECON134,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,B,No,Lots of busy group casework during the pandemic for no reason at all. Very theoretical - you can tell he's not practicing and does not actually use the correct terminology used in the industry. He is nice and accessible outside of class for questions. Typical prof where you can memorize what he teaches and you'll pass. No room for thinking.,Murat Binay ,Economics department
 PHIL033,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Professor Schroeder is admirably masterful in his teaching abilities - he has a knack for laying out complicated ideas clearly and logically. His lessons are challenging yet graspable, and he is well respected by his students. His class improved my abilities to construct logical arguments and have them stress-tested with opposing views.",Andrew Schroeder ,Philosophy department
 GOV70,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Extremely intelligent and knowledgeable. Great at fostering discussion and really teaches IR theory well while keeping it interesting. You have to work hard to get a grade but it's worth all the effort. Final paper is long but if you meet with her to talk about it you'll do fine.,Kristin Fabbe ,Government department
 FHS,3.5,1.0,,,,No,"The material is pretty dry I would say and it was difficult for me to engage with some of his ideas. However, it is one of those classes where you will do very well if you give him what he wants. If you take notes on exactly what he says and basically put that in your paper, you are golden. He is very nice and accessible though. Not a hard A.",Brian McGrath ,Literature department
 FWS010,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"While I loved this class, I would only take it if you already feel confident in your writing ability. His feedback is sparse and he's sometimes hard to access outside of class. His grading criteria is unclear and the prompts are open ended which can be difficult. However, he's a genius, and some of the books we read changed my whole view on writing",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department
 PHIL030,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A+,No,"Professor Yang swears a lot and gives entertaining lectures. That being said, he is not an easy grader  though. The class itself is very organized and I benefited a lot from discussions. Would take again",Eric Yang ,Philosophy department
 FWS010,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"At first he'll give you a reading list of 10 books but honestly we only read 1-3 chapters in each book. Don't buy the books. They're easily accessible online. No midterms or finals, only midterm/final papers. He's a chill fun guy",Evan Kindley ,Literature department
 LINEARALGEBRA,4.0,3.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"Really cool guy for Linear Algebra. I wouldn't recommend him for Calc. He's a young prof who doesn't have much experience, but his courses have gotten better (read: funnier, easier to succeed, more enjoyable classes) every semester he's taught. His lectures are pretty clear, it's hard to get lost during them. ",David Krumm ,Mathematics department
 FHS10,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Her FHS Nature and society class was super interesting and engaging in my opinion (discussions about native land, and colonialism). There were only 3 essays over the course of the semester plus a group project. It is a super manageable class and not hard to get a good grade if you write about the message she wants you to get out of the readings.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department
 OCHEM,5.0,2.0,,,A-,Yes,Professor Iafe is such a great professor. He dedicates so much time to his students and truly wants everyone to succeed. He provides the best review sessions and even organizes reaction sheets and charts just to make it easier on students. His practice tests are essentially the exact same format as tests and he's very fair with partial credit!,Robert Iafe ,Chemistry department
 ECON101,4.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A+,No,"Easy A, it's a lot easier if you have calc 3 before/know how to do math. She doesn't give you much time on tests, but curves hard on midterms.",Oana Tocoian ,Economics department
 BIOL177,2.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"If I had the opportunity to go back, I would have taken the alternate Biochemistry class at Pomona with a lab...  This guy is a joke.  Lectures seem to be intuitive, along with the book, but expect to be far more detailed than reasonable on the exams.  WE ARE NOT PhD STUDENTS.  I love this subject, but this instructor really hampered that for me.",Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department
 CS55,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"One of the best math profs I've ever had. Her lectures are crystal clear--you can copy what she writes into your notes and understand it all. P-sets are just the right level of challenging. She always replies to emails, and she's patient and straightforward in office hours.",Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department
 ECON086,1.5,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,"The best way to put it is, only take him if you need to take accounting this semester and he is the only teacher left. Avoid him unless absolutely necessary. Great guy, terrible teacher.",Douglas McEachern ,Accounting department
 CS51,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,No,"Wonderful professor with a geeky sense of humor. Great at explaining concepts, very understanding of his students, and made me fall in love with CS again.",John Sun ,Computer Science department
 ECON120,2.5,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Professor Yoon is a tough professor, but pretty manageable once you learn what to expect from him. If you study the homework and class examples closely, you shouldn't have a problem with any of the quizzes or tests. He is not very engaging, and it is easy to get distracted because every desk has a computer. Helpful in office hours.",Jungmo Yoon ,Economics department
 ARBC033,4.0,3.0,,,A,Yes,"Fantastic professor. Her class can certainly be daunting, but she also definitely means well. She is very friendly and willing to help. I have taken two classes with her so far and both have been very challenging but equally helpful. Study hard, ya shabab. You need to understand   what she's teaching in order to succeed. I recommend office hours.",Ghenwa Hayek ,Modern Languages department
 OCHEMLAB,2.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"As a lab prof, I would make appointments with her to ask questions and get help on reports. She would flat-out not show up to appointments and made no effort to help. I had to rely on coincidentally meeting other Ochem professors in her office.",Gretchen Stanton ,Chemistry department
 FHS1,4.5,4.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"I appreciated Stergiopoulos' class.  Stimulating, rewarding, helpful during office hours.  She strikes the perfect balance b/w allowing students freedom and shutting down BS.   Discussion in class was very organic and supplemented by her extensive preparation.   Only thing: I sometimes felt my grade was predetermined.",Kathryn Stergiopoulos ,Literature department
 PSYCH150,4.5,2.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,"Dr. Sterling's main strength is that she is very easy to relate to. She makes her lectures interesting and relevant, and keeps the class organized. She's also very receptive to student feedback and understanding of what it is like to be a college student.",Lindsey Sterling ,Psychology department
 FWS101,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Papers assigned are as difficult as you make them out to be, depending on the prompt chosen. You benefit the most from his class if youre already a good writer & want to challenge yourself to gain clarity in flow & originality in your ideas. I personally enjoyed the philosophical readings that supplemented the literature aspect of this class.",Giulio Pertile ,Literature department
 ECON159THEORY,5.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,"A very different kind of class that focuses on theoretical ideas rather than typical accounting problems. Some of the material is really out there, but Pete loves the stuff and it shows. The main part of the class involves him calling on 2 people per class to answer questions, which can be pretty scary, but he's super nice and grades so generously.",Peter Bergevin ,Economics department
 GOVT100,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof Rose is great! Extremely smart, gives good feedback and is very accessible outside of class. The fact that she made Stata and Econ pretty easy and very accessible for someone like myself, who hadn't taken econ or done coding/used data analysis software before, shows how great of a prof she is. highly recommend!",Shanna Rose ,Government department
 MATH109,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Tests are very clear cut and is very lenient on grading them too!,Blake Hunter ,Mathematics department
 HIST136,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Hopper is one of the best professors at CMC. He cares deeply about his students, war simulations, and makes history engaging. Taking 2 of his classes has made me consider switching my major to history. What you put into this class is what you get out of it. Only people highly engaged will receive As. I've never learned more about history.",Ian Hopper ,History department
 CHEM116,1.0,5.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"Terrible Professor, unreasonable person, doesnt want you to do well in her class",Neeraja Dashaputre ,Chemistry department
 ECON134,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Dr. Warachka restored my faith in Academia. He is really nice and helpful, down to earth, and available to students. You can tell he really cares about students and wants them to understand the material and succeed in the course (This is more rare than people think). Lectures are very informative and interesting.  I would definitely take him again ",Mitch Warachka ,Economics department
 GOVT70,3.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"I thoroughly enjoyed taking GOVT70 with Professor Saltzman. He kept class interesting and you could tell he was very passionate about the course material. He does cold call on students sometimes, but if you are taking notes or keep up with the reading, you shouldn't be taken off guard. Would definitely take a class with him again.",Ilai  Saltzman ,Government department
 CHEM15,3.0,4.0,Yes,,,No,"I've had better chemistry professors. Unless you do really well, it's difficult to get your grade up because there is no extra credit or test revisions. He does meet in office hours, which can be helpful. The textbook was awful so I relied on him to teach me everything. Therefore, I wish we were given more examples for how to do calculations. Meh",Cameron Iverson ,Chemistry department
 BIO43,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Cohen is extremely dedicated and his course is very challenging. He's friendly, open, and readily available for help at any time. His lectures are engaging and entertaining, while at the same time informative, clear, and accessible. Grading criterion is specific, and grading is very fair.",Joseph Cohen ,Biology department
 ECON125,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,Online lecture videos were fantastic,Angela Vossmeyer ,Economics department
 PHYS030,2.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Fun person, but needs some time to improve as a professor. The test questions can be vague, so if you are confused, you should ask him to clear it up. Sometimes important info can be missing. Definitely do the homework well to prepare for the tests. Grading is strange, but very detailed oriented. Include units on everything, even scratch work.",Kevin Moore ,Physics department
 HIST179,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Lower is so knowledgable about her field, and all semester I found myself leaving class having learned way more than I thought possible. Her lectures are super interesting, especially when she shares her own research experiences. There's a lot of reading and a super long paper, so if you're not a history major, tread carefully.",Wendy Lower ,History department
 HIST071,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,This is the second course that I have taken with Professor Cooper. This class was very similar to my experience with the last class: A WONDERFUL PROFESSOR. Professor Cooper has such a passion for what he teaches that it is actually challenging to not enjoy what he is teaching. He is the most caring professor I have ever had. G-Coops is the MAN.,Glen Cooper ,History department
 CHEM015L,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,Rinaldi makes sure to explain the basis of every concept and really helped me feel more confident about Chemistry. She's got a great sense of humor and is very relatable. Outstanding chemistry teacher!,Arlie Rinaldi ,Chemistry department
 CHEM116L,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof Hurlocker is great, we truly aren't worthy. So helpful, and a very cool person. Seems intimidating at first but she's really great",Brisa Hurlocker ,Chemistry department
 GOVT124B,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof Pears made a (somewhat) dry subject so interesting and fun. She's a great prof and a master at facilitating discussion. Really tough grader on papers, but also gives the most feedback on them that I've ever gotten. One of the best profs I've had in Claremont!",Emily Pears ,Government department
 FHS010,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,Professor Antill was a great FHS teacher. Class was Faith and Reason and he really knew how to analyze religious arguments. Class was very thought provoking and interesting. No textbook only online readings too! Only criticism is he grades papers pretty tough and they are 90% of your grade and his grading scale isn't totally clear.,Gregory Antill ,Philosophy department
 BIOL043L,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Tested vague concepts, often too difficult for the scope of an intro class (ex: had to memorize all the amino acid structures and groups). Focused only on specific topics rather than important concepts of Biology. Condescending and unapproachable outside of class. Terrible lecturer and often couldn't answer questions asked by students in class.",Jonathan Holt ,Biology department
 BIO148,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof. Chen is one of the most genuinely kind and caring professors at Keck! She starts off the semester trying her best to learn everyone's style of learning and often goes out of her way to cater to each unique learning style. She's intelligent and honest, and challenges her students in the best ways possible. Definitely loved her and her classes!",Audrey Chen ,Biology department
 CS55,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Such an amazing professor! Loved the material and how he taught it. Such a nice professor, and extremely knowledgeable on the subject. Great class and would definitely take him again!",Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department
 LEAD10,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Sara is wonderful. she's funny, knows the material so well, and is really understanding. Class is seminar, but she breaks for ath tea and over half of class time is activities so it doesn't feel long. Big on group work, even though there's only 1 group project. Very easy workload with short readings. Would recommend! I actually learned a lot",Sara Thompson ,Leadership department
 NEURO95,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,Horrible Professor. Avoid at all cost if you want to learn.,Anastasia Nagel ,Biology department
 HIST059,2.0,5.0,Yes,,B,Yes,"Very slow, boring lectures. The midterm was difficult and we were expected to remember small details from previous in class conversations, so if you missed a class you were at a serious disadvantage. The midterm essay prompt was also very poor. She is a nice person, but she does not inspire or teach at the level I expected.",Chelsea Wang ,History department
 RLST166,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"He knows A LOT about his subject, and he is always willing to share more after class. Because his assignments aren't graded harshly, you can really focus on the material. If you do the readings and notes, there is a lot of homework, but most students learn to be pro-skim readers. But honestly, to make the most of the class, you have to read it all.",Justin Doran ,Religious Studies department
 BIO44,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,Personally I enjoyed her class. She was really helpful outside of class and would always go the extra way to help you understand a concept you didn't understand. Plus there's tons on extra credit literally like 10% of your final grade because she accepts tests corrections for partial credit. I would take her again.,Princess Gilbert ,Biology department
 ECON102,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,"I don't recommend, he's not great. He's a new teacher and can be confusing to follow.",Matt Delventhal ,Economics department
 BIO141,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,Easily the worst professor I've had at the 5Cs. Her tests are hard and she expects students to know a lot despite giving terrible lectures. Her grading criteria is unclear and she is not helpful in office hours. She generally is not a friendly professor. Do not take classes with her.,Rachel Racicot ,Biology department
 ECON125,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B-,Yes,"Live Love Gillen. He made Metrics easy to understand. Lectures were a bit boring, but he tries. Go to his office hours and he's super helpful too. Super generous with grading, and he's hilarious!",Benjamin Gillen ,Economics department
 FWS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,The readings were always interesting and discussions in class were very engaging. She responded to everyones comments about the readings and everyone was able to get a deeper understanding of every reading we talked about.,Annie Wyman ,Literature department
 CSCI145,1.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,He is nitpicky and doesn't care about students. He can never wait to end classes early. Butchered students' names for an entire semester and didn't bother to ask them how to pronounce it. Flat out refuses to give points back when disputing grades even when the student is right. Refuses to bump a letter grade up when you're literally 0.1 away.,Pavel Naumov ,Computer Science department
 HIST114,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,Prof. Sarzynski is an incredibly knowledgeable historian. The assignments are creative and well structured. She is always available and willing to help with the writing process during her office hours. You need to do your work. I enjoyed the class discussions.,Sarah Sarzynski ,History department
 MATH060,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Helen is my favorite professor yet. She is so kind, loves math, and understands her students. She is open to feedback and just wants to be the best for her students. Everything she expects is very clear. Her exams are difficult but no curveballs. Questions may be difficult, but you have the skills to solve them. Highly recommend!",Helen Wong ,Mathematics department
 ARBC044,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof. Thomas is a sweetheart! Classes are a bit disorganized and don't really follow the syllabus though. It's clear she's under pressure by the Arabic Dept to teach specific things, but I found the lessons she created herself to be more helpful to my understanding of the language. Lots of quizzes but her expectations are always reasonable",Marie Claude Thomas ,Modern Languages department
 PHIL191,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Prof. Basu's a gem. I took Race and Policy with her (a lot of race and very little policy). The class material was engaging and there was class discussions every day. She uses these mini quizzes that were due for every class day and 2 essays to grade in addition to participation. shes extremely understanding!,Rima Basu ,Philosophy department
 GOVT149,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,I really enjoyed Professor Favretto's class. It was not very difficult but the content was interesting. The class was lecture-heavy and your grade depends on only two tests and one paper. An A is definitely attainable.,Katja Favretto ,Government department
 ECON86,4.0,5.0,Yes,No,C,Yes,"This prof is a bit scary when you are first getting to know him; he calls on people at random and gets frustrated when you don't understand. BUT he is also very kind, and genuinely wants us to succeed. You learn most of the concepts from the textbook and then go over the problems and exercises in class so don't skip your reading! AlwaysBe prepared.",James Taylor ,Accounting department
 BIOL131,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,"His lectures are so boring and hard to follow, but also he doesn't put any notes on the slides so if you don't have in-class notes you're screwed for the tests. It's basically just an MCAT prep class and Borchert seems neither qualified for or interested in teaching this class. There were times he did not know what he was talking about or was wrong",Jason Borchert ,Biology department
 GOVT112,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Pretty good class. Can be abrasive and cocky towards students, but willing to accept your arguments if they are meritorious. Certainly an expert with a good grasp on where class discussions are going and in what ways he should guide. Hard grader relative to other humanities/social sciences, but not unreasonable and will tell you if your idea sucks",George Thomas ,Government department
 ECON101,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,If I could take him for all my Econ courses at CMC I would! His lectures are amazing! He describes everything so incredibly well in class and is always happy to go over it again in office hours if you ask him! Problem sets help you study for the midterms. An overall fun and engaging class! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!,Jeffrey Flory ,Economics department
 HIST139E,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"JP's class was my favorite class I have ever taken. He has an unreal level of experience in his field of Weimar/Nazi Germany. Zoom class with Petropoulos was full of some of the best presentations I've ever seen. He always kept the course interesting, but we wrote 20 pages of papers during the final 2 weeks. I can't wait for my next class with JP",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department
 ECON86,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Econ86 is a must take if you go to CMC. Ganguly teaches in a flipped classroom style, which is different from the other accounting professors, but I found it to be the most useful way to learn all the content in accounting because there is a lottttt to learn. He has very high expectations, but that is because he cares about his students succeeding.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department
 GOV90,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,Yes,I would only take this class if you are having an affair with Scalia's ghost.,Ralph Rossum ,Government department
 ECON187,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I LOVED Prof Bjerk. An econ class that really made you think with a professor who took think the time to answer everyone's question. Sometimes he cold called, but as long as you did the reading, it wasn't a problem. Really learned a lot, and Bjerk came at things very objectively but still with a great passion.",David Bjerk ,Economics department
 ECON086,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Rather not say,No,"Professor Finley did a great job converting his ECON086 class into the virtual pandemic environment. His course is the most organized virtual course at CMC I've seen, and he is very accessible to help students. If you put in the time and effort, he will work with you.", Andrew Finley ,Economics department
 CHEM121,2.0,1.0,Yes,No,A,No,"Fuc is funny and getting an A in pchem was easy - just two open note exams. That's it. And you're allowed to ask questions on them. However, it was grueling because I didn't learn single thing and all you rely on is notes. He doesn't really teach- just writes his notes on the board in barely legible handwriting and his office hours are his phone #",Anthony Fucaloro ,Chemistry department
 RLST171,1.0,2.0,Yes,No,A,Yes,"Not a hard class, but all of the work is terrible. Each essay is dictated sentence by sentence what you need to write and it's just a cookie cutter response to a lot of really shallow, mostly plot based questions that oftentimes don't even feel relevant to the movies. It just takes a long time and is rote work. Online class was also a trainwreck.",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 PSYCH96,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,A,Yes,Reed assigned a lot of readings and worksheets. Tests were okay but too lengthy. Overall a very caring professor. She also gave out a lot of tips about college and life in general.,Catherine Reed ,Psychology department
 GOV020,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Prof. SInclair truly knows his field and tried his best to make quite a dull compulsory course (GOV020) as interesting as possible. He is heavy on papers (1x12 page, 2x6 page, 1x4 page) than exams (1xbig final, no midterms). His prompts were not the easiest to understand and he tends to reply to emails with one-word answers which wasn't helpful.",Andrew Sinclair ,Government department
 ECON102,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Madison is the best Economics professor I've had at CMC. Don't get me wrong, you'll have to put in work to do well because the class material is very difficult, but Professor Madison explains everything step by step in a very thorough and easy to follow manner. He's always willing to answer questions during and outside of class as well.",Florian Madison ,Economics department
 ECON050,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,A-,Yes,"Although he is unquestionably a nice man, I deeply do not recommend Ozbeklik. His classes don't adequately prepare you for your midterm and final (which are worth 60%), and his lectures are the most painful I have ever sat through. His grading is wildly arbitrary for written exams. If you have the option, take Econ50 with a different professor.",Serkan Ozbeklik ,Economics department
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Professor Lincoln is one of my favorite professors. His lecturing may be a bit dry at first, but he gets better as the semester progresses and tells fun stories that help you remember things too. When he comes across a particularly difficult topic that he knows students usually get stuck on, he waits for students to ask questions.",William Lincoln ,Economics department
 GOV20,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"There's quite a bit of reading for Prof. Kesler's class but they are very comprehensible even for students without previous U.S. government knowledge. The class can be a little boring if you're not into gov but he's a good gov20 choice, not too harsh of a grader",Charles Kesler ,Government department
 MATH032H,2.0,2.0,Yes,No,A,No,"I did not like prof Nelson. Not only attendance wasn't required, he literally did not give lectures. He just dropped a lecture pdf and students read it themselves. It is very easy to get an A, but you won't learn a single thing.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 GOV113,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Only had two 20 page papers for semester. Long papers but if you read the articles on his list and ask for feedback before turning it in, he will read your paper and tell you what grade you would get.",Frederick Lynch ,Government department
 FIN420,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,"Smart, but doesn't know how to teach. Asking questions in class or office hours didn't help me and I had to teach myself the whole class",Fan Yu ,Accounting department
 FWS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I love Professor Martinez. She is the nicest instructor I have had during my time in college. The topic of FWS was interesting, and she is clearly very passionate about the subject. She cares so much about her individual students. Class is difficult because she is a tough grader (she works in the CWPD), but you will learn a lot.",Mellissa Martinez ,Literature department
 ECON050,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,"Professor Evans' classes are so engaging; she is the only prof I've ever had who could keep me awake for 7:30am classes. She is also really accommodating and caring. Her exams are hard and you need to study a lot to do well, but there are lots of opportunities to meet with her outside of class.",Mary Evans ,Economics department
 HIST100,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Love love love Prof F!! My favorite freshman year professor! Honors history is a lot of reading and a long class period but she made the class go by fast!

Highly recommend any of her classes!,Heather Ferguson ,History department
 BIOL175,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I love prof faldyn! I had no experience coding in R before this class, but I never felt overwhelmed from unfamiliar material. He's very passionate and is a clear lecturer. His class was well-structured over zoom, with bi-weekly open note assessments and weekly coding problem sets in R. Though he gives a lot of work, it's not hard at all to do well!",Matthew Faldyn ,Biology department
 PHIL181,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,"Dr. B is a great professor. Her lectures are engaging and she will really push you to think in new ways.

 PHYS35,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Prof Gould is amazing!! You should take any class you can with him! He's fair and puts in a lot of time and energy for all his classes.,Scot Gould ,Physics department
 BIO143,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,He is a really nice man. Generally not the hardest class but it was often confusing as to what was expected. The class was a large lecture and sometimes it was hard to determine what was actually important to take notes on. He is what I see as the stereotypical college professor. Often the textbook was too hard / too in-depth and was not helpful.,Patrick Ferree ,Biology department
 FREN002,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,A,Yes,"oooof. ya no. I mean did I learn french? Sure! was it mentally exhausting, tear inducing, frustrating, and unmotivating but sure.

A lot of this had to do with special covid circumstances but",Bana Dahi ,Modern Languages department
 FHS010,2.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Didn't enjoy this class v much... he complained about Chodosh & talked politics an unnecessarily annoying amount for a class where it wasn't super relevant; he either yell-lectured at the camera or we read aloud in class which made it pretty boring. Didn't follow the syllabus. I can see how he may be some peoples' vibe, but to each their own.",Giorgi Areshidze ,Government department
 FHS10,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Though I didn't find the FHS Religion & Modernity interesting, Michon is a brilliant professor and imparts you with a lot of knowledge in class.

 HIST169,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,"Professor Kalb's Global South Asia class was the HIGHLIGHT of my semester.

 GOV70,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Professor Koch is an AMAZING teacher. There were many prerecorded lectures, but they were interesting and weren't too long like other professors.

 ECON101,4.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,Drop/Withdrawal,Yes,"Love Professor Olfati - she's very nice. I have heard she has gotten more difficult lately. I found her tests and problem sets to be difficult, but I do not believe that was due to an issue with her teaching. The class is very lecture heavy - zoning out for a minute or two can be fatal. What she requires is reasonable. Econ at CMC is generally hard",Saman Olfati ,Economics department
 PHYS031,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I think Wells had a rough start to teaching and rubbed people the wrong way. I also think that people don't like physics and take it out on him.

He's a very good teacher.",James Wells ,Physics department

 HIST122,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,The best class I have ever taken at CMC with the best professor I have ever taken.

I can't recommend this class enough!,Diana Selig ,History department
 FWS010,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Don't take his FWS. He is a nice guy, genuinely I like him as a person. However, as a teacher, he is quite vague with what he wants (as in no prompts), especially in terms of essays (which are 5 pages). I haven't learned anything in terms of being a better writer, which makes the class a waste of time.",Robert Von Hallberg ,Literature department
 PHYS034,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"Professor Landsberg is for you if you actually want to learn physics. Take this class if you are ready to invest around an hour a day to work on physics, and will actually enjoy it. Landsberg truly cares about his students and is very approachable in office hours. He explains things quite clearly and will not talk down to you. Loved this class.",Adam Landsberg ,Physics department

 ECON135,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"This class is my favorite econ class to date. Kind of an intersection between history and econ. I feel so much more informed and able to participate in finance and current event discussions.

 ECON154,5.0,4.0,,Yes,,Yes,"Best class I have taken at CMC, hands down. Professor McAniff cares incredibly about his students and really tries to emphasize topics that you will directly use in the real world.

Tall workload, but he is a fair grader.",Peter McAniff ,Economics department
 PSYCH81,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Great prof. Attendance is really important and especially being on time. There are online quizzes that make up a ton of your grade so do well on them. Sona Systems deadlines are super important to her as well.,Tomoe Kanaya ,Psychology department
 HIST099,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,"Prof Geismer is very nice and always tries to improve the quality & experience of class. Though her paper topics are weird. Office hours are too short.

You'll fail if you use the passive voice!",Lily Geismer ,History department
 ECON120,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof Raviv made stats interesting and easy to understand. The only issue is that he speaks very quickly, so it would be hard to keep up if you can't watch the recordings of class. Since it was online, exams were open note, which helped a ton. If it wasn't open note, it would be harder but still okay bc you get a formula sheet. A solid choice.",Yaron Raviv ,Economics department
 PPE001,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"She is honestly a brilliant professor! Ask her about anything from history to politics to philosophy and she will have an answer.

 HIST106,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Bjornlie is extremely knowledgeable eloquent, and passionate about History. Class is reading heavy and classes are loosely structured lectures/ discussions.

This makes a lot of his grading feel somewhat arbitrary.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department
 PSYCH040,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"She is an incredibly difficult professor, but teaches very well. I spent on average 1-2 hours in her office every single week for the last half of the semester and barely got an A in the class. Go to office hours if you want to do well.

Love her!",Jennifer Taw ,Government department
 LIT68,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,Professor Lobis is the best Professor Ive had at CMC. Hes brilliant and speaks so precisely it inspires you to choose words more carefully.

He brings alive the brilliance of Shakespeare!,Seth Lobis ,Literature department

 PHIL034,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,Great professor and interesting class. Readings can be a bit long but they are interesting and worth reading. There are reading responses which consist of about 10-12 sentences regarding the reading and they are due the day before your class at 2 pm which can be a bit inconvenient. Other than that great class!,Joseph Frigault ,Philosophy department
 FWS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Love her! She's the sweetest prof and you can tell that she loves what she teaches.

There's a reading before every class, and you have to submit 400 words every week.",Ellen Rentz ,Literature department
 CHEM29,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"Purvis-Roberts is one of the most caring and overall nicest professors I have ever had. She genuinely wants to see her students succeed and is great in office hours.

 CSC040,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,This course is difficult- don't get me wrong. But it would probably be easier than equivalent courses offered at HMC or Pomona. Our assignments helped build out our Github while being useful/practical. Mike clearly states that it will take 12 - 15 hours of work a week for an A- and that's pretty accurate. Put in the work and go to tutoring!!,Michael Izbicki ,Computer Science department
 PSYC37,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Org psych with Bowman was interesting and easy. Our grade was based on 3 exams, which sounds bad, but the exams were very straightforward. Mostly multiple choice with a couple of short answer questions that were always about theories we went over in class. If you read the textbook and take notes during lectures, this should be an easy A.",Craig Bowman ,Psychology department
 SPAN102,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I loved this class so much! He is such an understanding and caring professor. The content of the class is super varied.

 PHIL135,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,"Professor Johnson is easily the sharpest professor in the CMC philosophy department. At least in her upper level classes, she is a very tricky grader and will make it very difficult to get an A. If you're interested in the content she teaches, she's a must-have professor. If not, her grading criteria will seem arbitrary and excessively difficult.",Gabbrielle Johnson ,Philosophy department
 PHIL030,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Lots of reading, good deal of writing, active participation in class is expected. This class will make you actively engage with and think about and debate the philosophical texts you're given. Excellent introduction to the field imo; it did feel like we were doing philosophy instead of merely reading it.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 PHIL030,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,Took an intro phil class with Professor Kind and it was decently engaging. The paper prompts were pretty difficult so I wish more time was spent teaching how to write a philosophy paper.

 MATH060C,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof Kao showed a ton of compassion during the online semester. She always made herself available outside of class and her usual office hours, offering students the chance to submit test corrections as well.

 PHIL158,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,A-,No,"Her class doesn't really feel like a philosophy class. She's overly formulaic and she generally expects you to interpret things the same way that she does.

That said, she's smart and not a bad professor... she just has some weaknesses.",Adrienne Martin ,Philosophy department
 PHIL100E,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Very thoughtful person who pushed me to become a better thinker and a more competent philosophy student.

Definitely one of the most intelligent professors I've ever had and I'm seriously considering having him as my thesis reader. Dope guy!,James Kreines ,Philosophy department
 CHEM116,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,"Professor Mackey kept with the flipped classroom, which I personally did not find very helpful - especially with how difficult OChem is already. In class, he was laid-back and he's always willing to answer questions about class material. However, the weekly quizzes and exams were fairly difficult. Be prepared to put in a few hours each day.",Joel Mackey ,Chemistry department
 GOV155,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Love Uvin! He is an engaging and fair teacher. Classes are discussion-based and you get out what you and your classmates put in (reading and effort-wise.)

 HIST116,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,Dr. Livesay is a gem to the Claremont Colleges.

He is very helpful in office hours and genuinely cares about his students.,Daniel Livesay ,History department
 PSYCH109,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,C,Yes,"Worst profesor Ive taken a class with at CMC. Unprofessional, condescending, and her teaching style is very lazy.

 PHIL038,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,He's a very likable and enjoyable professor. I would highly recommend! Really interesting readings that are also very manageable. There isn't too much homework.

Grading seemed arbitrary, all about giving out the right number of each grade. ",Esther Chung-Kim ,Religious Studies department
 FHS104,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"His FHS course on Coffee is a MUST take. I loved all the guest lectures and discussions in class. Reading may be heavy, but very interesting. Only two papers: one midterm and one final. He is so passionate about the subject and makes you want to learn more. Highly recommend.",Jamel Velji ,Religious Studies department
 PSYC037,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"I loved taking this class, and I recommend taking this over psyc030 if you're looking to fill a GE requirement. The info you learn is so much more applicable and actually useful. The grading criteria isn't too clear, but because of that, it's easy to do well. The tests are easy to bs because most of the content is pretty intuitive. ",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department
 GOV80,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,Ive taken two classes with Nadon and still dont know what he thinks himself about the many topics covered in class. He argues only from the point of view of the authors being discussed In my other classes professors allow you to just give your views on any subject. Nadon insists that your also give an argument. This is why I came to college.,Christopher Nadon ,Government department
 PSYC145,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Awesome prof. and class! If you want to understand the left-right divide, take this class. If you want to understand human nature - take this class. It's discussion-heavy, but participation is actually really fun and exciting. It's all about thinking on the spot. There will controversial topics - but that's what education is about!",Piercarlo Valdesolo ,Psychology department
 LIT162,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof Shelton is very kind and passionate about the subject material. She has the tendency to ramble, but it's never about something irrelevant or boring. The books are well-chosen, but we didn't spend as much discussing the books as I'd wished. The amount of reading is manageable, and I would definitely take another class with her.",Marie-Denise Shelton ,Modern Languages department
 GOVT134,4.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Camp is a fantastic scholar and by far one of the kindest professors I have met. Although his lectures can be a bit of a lull, he is clearly passionate about and able to effectively convey the course material. He assigned a decent amount of reading and three essays. Talk to him. You will get a better understanding of the material if you do.",Roderic Camp ,Government department
 ECON165,1.0,5.0,Yes,,B+,No,"He pretends to have very clear grading (1-10) but in reality he takes off points without any explain for why. He  also loves to nitpick everything, if it isn't perfect and in his language it's not an A. If you do SVP, the class is a requirement which is unfortunate because he is NOT good professor and grades arbitrarily. No office hours either",Darren Filson ,Economics department
 FREN33,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"My fav. prof at cmc! If you're looking for a class that get's you an easy grade, she's not the prof for you, especially if ur taking french just to get your GE's out of the way. You have to put an effort into studying, but if you do that then you'll be fine. She's so bubbly and cute and I always looked forward to her class everyday.",Sylvie Young ,Modern Languages department
 CHEM120,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"I guessed on the course number.. this was for OChem last year.  He is a great prof and grades fairly.  He's pretty organized, and he's very dedicated to helping his students.",Adam Johns ,Chemistry department
 BIO042,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,No,Extremely knowledgeable and interesting. Tons of interesting demos! But his class is extremely difficult and I found that I either completely understood the material or got lost in his words. He really cares about his students and is always free to meet!,Babak Sanii ,Chemistry department
 ECON050,4.0,1.0,,,,No,"Great professor! Really funny, has an accent, but it only makes the class so much more interesting. Everyone gets 100% on the assignments and the tests are not too hard. Wish he'd stay here permanently",Meric Keskinel ,Economics department

 ECON101,2.5,3.0,Yes,,,No,"Wright has a ""cult following"" status among CMCers. They have good reason for this -  he is a hidden gem of CMC. Despite his reputation, he's a great talker. Even though his teaching style and tests might make the class difficult, Wright is helpful in office hours & is willing to give out good grades despite a hard, but hilarious, class.",Colin Wright ,Economics department
 LIT10,1.5,4.0,,,,No,"Before I took the class I thought that Meyer's ratings were tough. They are not. Professor Meyer does not care about her lit 10 classes and she does not prepare for them. She is not that hard, but she assigns grades quite randomly.",Ann Meyer ,Literature department

 PHIL30,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Davis is an excellent lecturer and a knowledgeable scholar of Philosophy.  He excels at presenting a relatively unbiased  , even-handed look at various historical philosophers.  The class is lecture based, but he does ask for student input. The course work is not particularly challenging, especially if you're interested in the subject matter.",Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department
 PSYCH109,5.0,3.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,No,She is amazingly clear in the lectures and capable of explaining concepts in different ways when necessary. Gives the most considerate and detailed study guide materials. Very dedicated to teaching. I'm not too into Stats but she was able to make it great a learning experience. Can't think of a better professor to take Psych Stats with! ,Shana Levin ,Psychology department
 SECT,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"as a person hes probably the funniest professor youll have at cmc and now that im out of the class i love the guy but hes too smart to be teaching entry level classes and is hard to understand a lot, also goes off topic a lot",Mario Martelli ,Mathematics department
 PSYCH065,4.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Charlop def knows her stuff after being in the autism center so long. A bit eccentric and weird but she is entertaining and an easy class.

 GOVT149,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Great professor. Passionate about the course material, has high expectations of students but gives them tools necessary to meet expectations, helps prepare students for the real world, gives really in depth and good comments on writing, have to read and write A LOT in his class, but its worth it...not just busy work. Lectures not boring but great!",Edward Haley ,Government department
 MATH30,3.0,2.0,Yes,,A,No,"It would definitely help to have some background in Calc before taking this class as he breezes over some of the important concepts, but overall it was an easy class. He gives trial quizzes that are identical to the real quiz, and will tell you all the possible questions he could ask beforehand. He also gives you 2 free pts on each quiz. Take him!!",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"If you like econ, he's not a bad intro class.  He doesn't care a whole lot about the class, but you do learn your stuff.",Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department

 ECON164,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"This class is very helpful- but as usual, I've found econ to be common sense+quant skills.  Smith helps you apply both.  She is not the most profound, but she is very clear.",Janet Smith ,Economics department
 FWS01,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Bilger is by far the best teacher I have had at CMC. She is a really great teacher who makes every class fun and interesting. We read a lot of great works in her class and she has truly helped me improve my writing. Take her class she will change your life!,Audrey Bilger ,Literature department
 MATH030,2.5,1.0,,,,Yes,his classes are easy but boring,James Pinter-Lucke ,Mathematics department
 CHEM040,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Great Teacher and Extremely helpful! she explains well , but lectures are extremely fast and very ""dense"" (material wise). she will cover a chapter per lesson and usually expects you to ""fill in the blanks"" ( what you didnt understand in class) by solving problems from the textbook. and a lot. thats how she expects you to get the material ""down"".",Mary Hatcher-Skeers ,Chemistry department
 HIS163,2.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"The professor is a nice guy, but his class is just way too boring. His lecture is not organized at all, and he just say whatever jumps to his mind. He gives way too much reading and the readings are boring but not as boring as his lecture. Don't take his class if you are really interested in Chinese history, cuz at the end of the semester you won't",Arthur Rosenbaum ,History department
 BIO176,4.5,2.0,,,,No,"Lectures are a bit sporadic, but combining notes with a few classmates, you can get the info needed to ace the exam. Very friendly, great attitude, adorable Australian accent, and very passionate about the info he teaches. Exams are similar to the past exams that he uses as practice exams. Little outside of class work. Very pleasant overall.",Donald McFarlane ,Biology department
 BIOL151L,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,so nice and accomodating. never gets angry with students and very sweet. not the best lecturer but if you even skim the book you're fine. very fair tests and quizzes. lab is boring but that's not her fault.,Robin Justice ,Biology department
 PHIL30,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A+,No,"Love Dean Huang. Great guy, extremely easy class while I still managed to learn a lot taking a GE. Teaches you how to argue clearly and logically as long as you participate plenty in class.",Jefferson Huang ,Philosophy department
 ECON86,3.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"He teaches by writing out notes and explaining them; lectures are pretty good, and he is clearly intelligent. However, the material can be dry and the textbook is terrible. There are 5 quizzes (full class periods) that are very fair and manageable if you study and know what you're doing. The overall class isn't amazing, but I would take him again.",Joshua Rosett ,Economics department
 MATH30,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,The only reason I passed this class was because I already took IB Calc before and couldn't get credit for it.  Avoid this professor!,Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department
 BIO44,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,Her tests are based on memorization rather than understanding of the material. Thus makes it hard for certain people. Will judge you based on whether or not you sit in the front or the back of class and if you bring your laptop or not. Very useful during office hours. Somewhat intimidating though.,Marion Preest ,Biology department
 BIO43L,1.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"She focuses only on ""feature investigations"" which are hard to understand because she doesn't teach the basic material well at all. She skips around on the board and isn't clear at all. I'm sure she is great of Molecular Bio but intro bio isn't her world.",Gretchen Edwalds-Gilbert ,Biology department
 GOVT125,4.5,4.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"I liked Professor Spalding. From her, I learned when to speak up and when to shut up. She expected me to actually know what I was talking about, and would listen to my arguments (even though I was a liberal) because I had reasoning and evidence behind each thing I said. She expects a lot out of you, and I think I was much better for it.",Elizabeth Spalding ,Government department
 BIO43,1.5,4.0,,,,No,"wonderful, sweet woman, but a truly awful teacher. She is one of those people who just has no teaching abilities. Her classes are disorganized, the homework does not match the lectures, and her tests are on material she has not covered. I could learn the material better if I just used the time I waste in class and hw each week on teaching myself",Irene Tang ,Biology department
 LIT87,4.5,5.0,,,,Yes,Professor bradley is a great teacher! he's got a great speaking voice and he dresses great and amazingly beautiful....overall I'd have to describe him as a tall mug of hot chocolate with tiny mini marshmallows :),Adam Bradley ,Literature department
 GOVSEMI,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Great Professor, very funny, definitely not the type to coddle you.  The most interesting government class I have taken at CMC.  His textbook was great to read, it was like he was just talking to you personally.  Not sure why the negative ratings, everybody who went on the DC Program my year thought he was one of the best Profs they ever had.",John Haskell ,Government department
 HIST330,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,I really liked Yoo's class. He planned a field visit for us to a Buddhist center. He also had former students come and talk to us about writing a dissertation and finding a job as a professor because he felt this was as important as the class material since most students were interested in teaching. Very easy to talk to and very friendly.,David Yoo ,History department
 PSYCHLAWETC,5.0,2.0,,,,,Informative and entertaining,Mark Costanzo ,Psychology department
 PSYCH141,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,He is a great professor. The majority of the grade is participation so you'll need to make sure you speak up. He is very clear in his expectations and his course readings are interesting. This was probably one of the best classes I've taken at CMC!,Jay Conger ,Psychology department
 HIST157,5.0,2.0,,,,,"Major Kirkland is the best. He is compassionate, funny, and actually keeps the class interesting. He also doesn't have unrealistic expectations on the amount of work we are supposed to do. I highly recommend him.",Robert Kirkland ,History department
 PSYCH131,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Prof. Halpern is a wonderful human-being. She is the top of her field (in sex differences) and many of the articles we read cited her work.  Excellent and enjoyable class- and she gives you a rice-krispie-candy break for tea :),Diane Halpern ,Psychology department
 ECON134,4.5,5.0,Yes,,A-,No,"She is an awesome lady in every way.  Best finance prof at CMC and maybe best prof overall.  She is also hilarious.  And hot, really hot.",Lisa Meulbroek ,Economics department
 GOV20,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Great teacher, knows what he's talking about because he was there. sometimes his lectures are long, he repeats the stuff he wants you to know for the tests over and over again so its easy to predict whats on the tests. If you study and pay attention you'll do great in the class.ask to meet him outside of class and he'll answer any question you have",Michael Uhlmann ,Government department
 FHS010,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,"Do not take Prof. Aitel's class. Incredibly difficult grader on papers even after meeting with her for help on papers multiple times and with the CWPD. I thought she would be easy given her rating on Rate My Professor, but it is MISLEADING. Fazia is kind in class, although her grading is harsh! Everyone in my class would agreed. Stay away!!",Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department
 PSYC030,1.0,2.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Professor Cook is awful and boring. He basically reads the slides out for you. Besides that, he gives pop quizzes so attendance is mandatory. Tests are easy if you study the textbook well. Otherwise, he is rude and often makes derogatory comments. I would NOT recommend this class.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 RS153,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,I gained true academic knowledge. He's interesting and engaging.,Kjell Lejon ,Government department
 BIO44,3.0,1.0,,,,No,This man is hilarious. He has very dry humor and digresses all the time. He uses a lot of the same questions on tests from practice tests and previous years. Unlimited time on tests as well.,Dan Guthrie ,Biology department
 ECON102,1.0,5.0,,,B,Yes,I really didn't like how he belittles you when you ask for help. He literally makes fun of you or gets mad if you ask question. That is even during office hours. You have not only memorize and understand every single page of the assigned reading but he always chose little topics that seemed not important and he did not emphasize during lecture.,Sven Arndt ,Economics department
 AISS1,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"I really really love professor Wiley. She is so enthusiastic and helpful and will bend over backwards to help her students with homework, labs, and research opportunities.",Emily Wiley ,Biology department
 CLIMB101,5.0,1.0,,,,No,Dave Hamilton is the man! His class is awesome.,David Hamilton ,Physical Education department
 SPAN102,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,She is the best spanish teacher there is.  Comes off as very intimidating at first but it a total sweetheart.  She is so funny and makes class really fun.  It's a lot of work but totally worth it.,Maria Martinez ,Modern Languages department
 ABNORMAL,1.0,2.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"He was insensitive when teaching a class that involves a sensitive topic. Also, the class involved purely on memorizing contents (which he told us what's going to be tested on - thus easy test) and NO critical thinking. He also taught based on old DSM-IV-TR not DSM 5. Such a bummer because the topic is supposed to be fascinating but the class wasnt",Wei-Chin Hwang ,Psychology department
 MATHE3,5.0,2.0,Yes,,A,No,"My first math class in years! Graham's funny and clear examples and teaching methods really made this class FUN, as hard as it is to believe. I aced it thanks to the availability of class videos which I re-watched at home, and the multiple weekly tutoring sessions made available by his awesome TAs. Definitely would take his classes again.",Graham Bird ,Economics department
 BIOL80,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Coleman is fantastic! I took neurobiology with her for the GE, and even though I didn't enjoy the subject material, I learned a lot. Professor Coleman is kind, funny, and clearly passionate about science.",Melissa Coleman ,Biology department
 ECON86,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Class is very structured and organized, which I liked. The lectures are pretty boring, though, especially if you're not interested in the subject, but not because of Batta, it's just the accounting material. It's a demanding workload, so if you fall behind a little, get help ASAP. He's willing to help you out.",George Batta ,Economics department
 SPAN33,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,Definitely plays favorites and can be very passive aggressive. She is easy to understand but does not provide much positive feedback at all,Catherine Wall ,Modern Languages department
 CIV20,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Aimaq took a required GE and turned it into one of the most intellectually stimulating classes I have taken at the 5Cs.  I didn't always agree with her POV, but she challenged my views and made me rethink my assumptions about the subject matter.  You might not get the easy A you would with another professor, but it will be worth it.",Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department
 BIO43,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"I didn't take any AP science classes in high school, and was actually pretty rusty in science, but I still managed to get a good grade in her class. Her lectures and drawings are based completely off the book, so if you don't get anything, you always have a literary reference. I was honestly never confused. She's very chipper, even at 8AM.",Jennifer Armstrong ,Biology department
 PHIL030,5.0,2.0,,,,No,"Professor Gardner is fantastic and really cares about presenting the information as clearly as possible.  With practice exam questions and availability for office hours, you are able to do very well as long as you put in some effort. Reading isn't always necessary, but being in class is vital for understanding the information.",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department
 CSCI040,2.0,5.0,Yes,,B+,No,This was my first computer science class. There were three written tests  (as opposed to homework assignments done on computers) given throughout the semester that were very hard. The professor was understanding when I talked to him in person but impatient with questions during class. He had a hard time explaining.,Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department
 ECON102,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"What a homie. You don't exactly know how to get an A, but he knows his stuff and makes class fun (""Let's talk about how you can impress people at a cocktail party"")",Brock Blomberg ,Economics department
 FHS10,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Super caring professor! Not a lot of homework - just weekly posts and readings which you should keep on top of.

Don't expect to get an A by doing the bare minimum...",Nita Kumar ,History department
 CALC032,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"She is a very good professor. I disagree with previous opinions. Once you study hard, you are rewarded. She is polite, generous, and beautiful.",Andrea Jedwab ,Mathematics department
 SPAN44,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Profesora Skinner was great, in retrospect. She makes the class really easy and engaging so that non-fluent students can actually learn. However, do not take her if you are a fluent speaker. She has a very noticeable accent when she speaks in spanish. Overall, a great professor!",Lee Skinner ,Modern Languages department
 CALCII,4.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"His teaching style is very good. During class, he teaches new material and then does a lot of example problems. The homework is really fast and easy, and if you've attended class (although you don't have to) the tests are easy too. I learned a lot, and I would definitely take a class from him again.",David German ,Mathematics department
 ECON173,1.5,5.0,,,,No,"Broussard is undoubtedly the worst professor I have ever had. I waited two semesters to take her Development Econ class because that's what she was hired for but it was a dud. She is completely incompetent, lazy, and a terrible teacher. She doesn't care at all about students, and any coolness factor is completely negated.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department
 BIO43,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"Scattered lectures, unfairly tough exams. For a class of non science majors, the average for the most recent exam was 71%. Although the labs were often interesting, the abysmal quality of lectures (and 4 hours of them straight) along with her exceedingly difficult exams means you should really think twice before you take her.",Amy Chow ,Biology department
 ECOMNECON,4.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"Great Guy! He spends the 1st 10 min of class usually talking about general stuff going on in the world. He then switches to teacher mode and teaches stuff. You probably wont cover the whole book, but whatever bits you do cover, you'll know inside out.",E Aksoy ,Economics department
 HIST161,4.5,2.0,Yes,,A,No,"Prof. Park is one of the best professors I had so far. He is very helpful and his instructions for the papers are very very clear. He presents interesting material but he also blends in a good amount of discussion. He is a good discussion facilitator and while he may seem intimidating at times, don't be!",Albert Park ,History department
 ECON102,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Though Shelton's macro is one of the harder intermediate classes, he will give you deep intuitive understanding on a wide breadth of subjects. Problem sets are hard, and reflect the command he expects his students to have over the material. As a human being, Shelton is personable, caring, responsive to feedback, and flexible with coursework.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department
 INVESTMENT,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,Horrible class. Hughson is smart but he just couldn't teach.,Eric Hughson ,Economics department
 BIOL1610,1.5,5.0,,,,No,"Other commenter was right on his lecture was pointless, he would talk the whole time and i would write down everything then none of that was on the test, instead he would have very vague questions that could have multiple answers so you didn't know which one was right. Hated the course...and I'm biology major and have liked every biology class",Jonathan Karpel ,Biology department
 ECON134,2.0,2.0,,,,No,"I had seen the material presented in this class previously as an undergraduate. It was presented much more effectively the first time. Barnea only seems to have a very superficial understanding himself, relying as he does so much on other people's publications and not answering questions very convincingly. His fluency in English is very weak.",Amir Barnea ,Economics department
 LIT10,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Noel is an excellent professor.She presented depressing and dark topics through the required reading yet always kept class discussion lively.Her dark sense of humor, if you can call it that, was slightly freaky but nothing short of interesting.Noel truly cares about all her students and wants nothing more than to see them succeed!",Katherine Noel ,Literature department
 GOV60,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"LOVED Professor Pei's Gov 60. One of the best professors I have ever had. I highly recommend this class, but only take it if you are interested in the subject.

 GOV121,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"I took this class in Spring '10 and just graduated this May. At the time it was a pretty demanding class, but has ended up being one of the most useful and relevant courses that I ended up taking at CMC.

 CHEM100,4.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Amazing energy! If you need help go to office hrs, he will help even if he is just in the bldg. outside of those hrs. Looked forward to going to lecture every time.

 ECON134,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Binay is one of the few professors that makes finance interesting at CMC. His class is extremely lecture-heavy, so take good class notes.

 GOV70,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Prof Fabbe is a great role model for female students. She is very smart and personable. ~6 pop quizzes because she was annoyed that we weren't doing the reading, but not bad.

 FWS105,3.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"McGrath knows his stuff, but his American Idealism class can be very frustrating. The class is purely discussion-based with little structure and he assigns a lot of long papers with ridiculous prompts. It's very easy to get a B, but takes a lot of work to get an A. Office hours always result in fascinating conversations!",Brian McGrath ,Literature department
 FWS02,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,"Leland (previously a Harvard Prof.) is one of the most intelligent professors I have ever had. The class changed the way I look at the world.

Lowest grade (B) I received last semester, but easily most enlightening.",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department
 PHIL30,4.5,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Very clear regarding the material and his expectations.  The argumentative paper is a bit difficult, but he is more than willing to talk to you about it.

 FWS010,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,He's a nice and quirky guy. The class isn't hard at all. Just 3 papers out which the 3rd one can be an expansion of the second. Just participate occasionally.,Evan Kindley ,Literature department

 FHS010,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,Do not take her FHS class unless you are majoring in environment!!! Her grading policy is unclear and she sets her standard impossibly high.

 MATH52,5.0,1.0,Yes,,,No,very good professor,Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department
 ECON086,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,No,"He is easily the worst teacher I have ever had. There is absolutely no structure to his 'lectures' and he often either loses his train of though or ventures down unnecessary and irrelevant tangents. Furthermore, his 'study guides' are pitiful and are of no help in preparing for exams. There is no upside to taking this class.",Douglas McEachern ,Accounting department
 62,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"He was very clear during lecture, although at times it was a bit boring. He was very fair and the class overall wasn't too hard. ",John Sun ,Computer Science department
 ECON125,3.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"His econometrics course was harder than his stats course, but he still was able to give homework and quiz problems that reflected what was on the exams.  Continues to teach R as well.  Not a bad class.",Jungmo Yoon ,Economics department
 OCHEM,2.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,Misleading bec seems like teaches everything to solve ?s but leaves important element out. Did not like how she decided to make a ? all or nothing to make the grade discretion large (Likes a 90% vs 70% gap btw students). There are ?s on test didn't learned in class. Told me a C+ (that's with curve) is a good grade and shouldn't worry. (yeah right!),Gretchen Stanton ,Chemistry department
 LIT097,2.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,Personally found her to be very boring. Lectures are dull and feel long. If you are enthusiastic about the material maybe it won't be so bad.,Kathryn Stergiopoulos ,Literature department
 LIT058,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Pertile is an approachable, reasonable, and truly caring professor who really knows how to engage you with literature. He gives great feedbacks to you if you need help with the essays, and will gladly make as many appointments as you'd like to get help. He is a hard grader, though, particularly in this high-level literature class.",Giulio Pertile ,Literature department
 ECON150,4.5,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,While the class was a little dry at times his lectures were very illuminating and crystal-clear - some of the most clear ones I've listened to. Exams were very fair and easy if you studied. A really jolly and completely unpretentious man - take accounting with him for sure!,Peter Bergevin ,Economics department
 GOV20,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Prof Rose is amazing. Class was reading-heavy, but there were only two 7 page papers and no midterms. Definitely go to her office hours to talk about your paper. She does give pop quizzes but you can very easily predict when they're going to be. She gives printouts of lecture slides, which makes note-taking very easy.",Shanna Rose ,Government department
 MATH151,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"He's a really good guy and sometimes he gets a little tripped up in his lecture notes, but his homework and tests are very manageable! He gives a clear outline of what his tests look like and posts many sample exams that are very similar to his actual test. Overall just very kind and reasonable.",Blake Hunter ,Mathematics department
 HIST136,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Hopper structured this class with the WWI simulation at the center. The simulation is a great experience, students have a lot of flexibility, and he is always available to give feedback. Most course readings are concentrated in the first month of the semester, and not dry at all. The overall workload is lighter than the average class.",Ian Hopper ,History department
 CHEM116,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,No,"O chem will be challenging no matter who you have, but Neeraja is great at teaching it! Her lectures are very informative, she holds extra problem sessions weekly, and she is helpful in office hours. Because she doesn't collect any homework, you have to be diligent with keeping up on the studying though.",Neeraja Dashaputre ,Chemistry department
 CHEM015L,1.0,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,"He only requires you to know the most basic information, yet still takes forever explaining easy concepts in a really unclear way. He also leaves out a lot of key information that would be helpful when solving problems or understanding concepts. Lectures are agony but tests are pretty easy if you study.",Cameron Iverson ,Chemistry department
 BIO171,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"One of my favorite professors ever. The class was definitely challenging, but I feel as though I really learned the material. Prof Cohen expects a lot of his students and in return dedicates a lot of time to them through extensive office hours and engaging lectures. I highly recommend taking one of his classes if you are willing to put in the work",Joseph Cohen ,Biology department
 ECON125,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Took her for econometrics. We take a lot of notes , but she engages with the class to us to understand the material. She is accessible and helpful outside of class. Material is difficult, but she is thorough with her explanations and expectations for the exam. Take metrics from her. But beware, her classes are always full!",Angela Vossmeyer ,Economics department
 PHYS30,2.5,4.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,Professor Moore is a new teacher and has a long way to go before he can truly become an amazing teacher. Although enthusiastic about teaching the material when asked about questions he seemed to be annoyed and even came off as condescending more than once. His grading is very detail oriented and exact and slight mistakes cost you greatly.,Kevin Moore ,Physics department
 HIST179,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"It IS lecture heavy but participation matters too! I loved Professor Lower's course on the Holocaust. I actually learned the most about a historical event I ever have. I highly suggest going to her office hours and reaching out to her, this is where you will see how much of a genius she is and how strongly she cares for all her students.",Wendy Lower ,History department
 FHS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,"FANTASTIC professor! Lectures were thorough and he clearly knows his stuff. Really cares about his students toowilling to help out during office hours and gives excellent guidance, and is very accommodating about illnesses. If you show up, getting the A is easy, but that doesn't detract from the learning at all. Highly recommend for FHS & History!",Glen Cooper ,History department
 BIOCHEM1,2.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"She's in good in office hours but rushes fast through the material. It's easy to fall off if you mess up on any section of the course (i.e homework, exams, presentation)",Arlie Rinaldi ,Chemistry department
 CHEM014,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Hurlocker was one of my favorite professors. I took both semesters of Intro Chem with her and they definitely required hard work but she was organized and did a good job going through material. Her office hours are amazing, she is so sweet, really knows how to explain specific concepts to you, and will work with you until you understand.",Brisa Hurlocker ,Chemistry department
 GOVT124B,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"I loved Professor Pears' class. She is such an intelligent and inspiring professor. There is a lot of reading and you're expected to participate.

I highly recommend taking any of her courses.",Emily Pears ,Government department
 PHIL167,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,Truly one of the nicest profs you will ever have. Super understanding and is willing to retell you the material countless times until you really understand it.

Will grant you extensions and grades generously,Gregory Antill ,Philosophy department
 BIO043L,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Unreasonable pacing with class material, easily 3 chapters ahead of other classes. Talked to Biochem prof and they didn't know why he was teaching some of things he did. Slides not nearly enough for review. Take only if you have time to invest.",Jonathan Holt ,Biology department
 CS55,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,"Shaar is one of the worst professors that I've had in the Claremont Colleges. The material he taught was not bad, but he could not teach it for his life. Also takes off unnecessary points and doesn't have a clear grading criteria. Final makes up your grade.",Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department
 BIO43,1.0,2.0,Yes,No,A,No,I think Prof Nagel is not a good communicator of science; I had a hard time understanding her vague examples and her lectures are mostly her reading the powerpoint slides. I don't recommend her but if you want an easy B without learning the material you might get away with her.,Anastasia Nagel ,Biology department
 HIST056,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Professor Wang is brilliant, young, and exciting. Refreshing at CMC. She's very open and gives specific and clear help. Classes entertained interesting ideas.",Chelsea Wang ,History department
 BIO44LAB,2.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Gilbert teaches at a turtle's pace; she doesn't seem to be able to answer any questions without consulting an answer key or lab manual. She gives no written feedback on lab reports, despite taking FOREVER to grade things. She is very nice, but that only gets you so far. Maybe she just needs more teaching experience, but for now, don't take her.",Princess Gilbert ,Biology department

 ECON125,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Gillen is so so smart, and genuinely cares about his students. Although he does use a lot of math and theory behind his econometrics, he also splits up class time to work tangibly on problems. He will also take time to answer any question during and outside of class.",Benjamin Gillen ,Economics department
 FWS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Open discussion classes, very reasonable paper lengths and prompts, lovely stories assigned. Prof. Wyman has an excellent understanding and knowledge of significance and context behind each story we read. Classes encouraged freedom of expression because Prof. W. listened, considered your idea, prompted class to respond and discuss before lecturing.",Annie Wyman ,Literature department
 CSCI145,1.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Literally the worst professor and class I've ever had. Lectures and notes are messy and confusing, and he can't explain the simplest of concepts. You learn nothing since the materials are actually middle school level easy (he taught us how to take standard deviations for 2 weeks). Did I mention he also gives zero care about students' well-beings?",Pavel Naumov ,Computer Science department
 FHS010,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Extremely unique and creative class where I really learned a lot! Sarah is very personable and caring! Readings aren't too heavy and movies are fun to watch! No pop quizzes, less than 10 forum posts, 2 average-sized papers, and one video final which was hard work but very fun and rewarding! Highly recommend for new way of thinking!",Sarah Sarzynski ,History department
 CALC32,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Great professor who cares about her students. She gives time to students who are struggling (Time during lectures to do more examples, loads of office hour times). Homework assigned for each Tuesday and Friday, but if you stay ahead, it is not as much as you think. If you study and make good formula sheets for the test, you will do well on tests.",Helen Wong ,Mathematics department
 PHIL34,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof. Basu is a solid choice for a Philosophy GE. Reading about Kant, Confusion philosophy, Aristotle was a bit tedious, though, she did make it as interesting as possible. In the second half of the semester, the class became fascinating, though. When working on papers, go speak to her regularly in office hours -- it will really boost your grade.",Rima Basu ,Philosophy department
 ECON86,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"He should not be teaching this intro class. The exams cover too much material, he is poor at explaining concepts, and gets upset at students when they do not understand the material he is poorly putting forward. The second exam covers 250 pages of dense text book.",James Taylor ,Accounting department
 BIOL131,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"This class is essentially a Bio MCAT prep course. You cover a ton of material, but not overly in depth. He is kind and helpful. This isn't his choice area and he got stuck teaching it, but he has a respectable goal: he wants you to learn SOMETHING. Exam's are easy. A blessing if you're taking other Keck sci classes w/ incompetent & HARD profs.",Jason Borchert ,Biology department
 GOV112,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,B-,Yes,"I think that professor Thomas has some favorites and I also believe that  he is not clear with what he wants in essays. . I took his Constitutional law class, and we almost never talked about the theories of constitutional interpretation or some fundamental  philosophies. Get ready to be an independent learner if you take him.",George Thomas ,Government department
 ECON173,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"Amazing guy. Go to office hours and form a solid relationship. He is very nice and will make an effort to ensure your success if he knows you are working hard.  His lectures go over the readings, therefore if you miss a reading here and there it will not be the end of the world. His slides are shared online and are very helpful for exams.",Jeffrey Flory ,Economics department
 HIST139,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Prof Petropolous is a fantastic professor and is probably too good for CMC -- he is the world expert in his field. He is hard but you will learn and lot!

Only take this class if you are willing to do the work, contribute: otherwise, it is probably not the class for you.",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department
 ECON086,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Very challenging for an intro class. Overcomplicates things that could be taught in easier ways. Expect to spend 10+ hours a week watching videos, doing HW quizzes and reviewing.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department
 GOVT112A,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,Teaches only through lecturing and doesnt engage with students. Often has anecdotes that can be somewhat entertaining but arent useful in terms of the tests or material. Not as easy of a class as his reputation on campus suggests.,Ralph Rossum ,Government department

 ECON86,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Yes, Finley is boring, but he is also very consistent and does not throw curveballs on exams. If you pay attention in class you will do well because exams are similar to class. He offers plenty of practice problems. He cares about his students learning accounting and effort. He did not make the class any easier during the pandemic which felt unfair", Andrew Finley ,Economics department
 CHEM014,3.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Fuc is very lecture heavy, which worked pretty well for me, but it's not for everyone. He's not very accessible (no office hours) but he does give you his phone number, and I've talked to him after class a few times and he's always been nice. Wouldn't say he's the best prof but he's not horrible. Also, he gives you last year's test as a study guide",Anthony Fucaloro ,Chemistry department
 FHS10,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Professor Espinosa is truly passionate about studying religion, which makes for interesting class discussions. The readings can be lengthy, but they are usually very interesting. Every other week you have to write a one-page summary/analysis of a particular reading. He is accessible outside of class, very caring, and tends to talk a lot.",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 PSY96,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,A,Yes,"Prof. Reed cares a lot about her students and is very passionate about the material. The lectures are pretty boring but as long as you put in the work, you will do well.

She is very accessible out of class and helpful.",Catherine Reed ,Psychology department

 ECON050,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,"Prof Ozbeklik was Ok but the lectures weren't really interesting. I could not pay attention during lectures, so I ended up skipping lectures and watching them later at 2.0 speed. Homework tests and quizzes are reasonable",Serkan Ozbeklik ,Economics department
 ECON101,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B-,No,"He gives you A LOT of practice, so it's easy to overlook or skip problems. DO ALL THE PROBLEMS IF YOU WANT TO DO WELL ON THE EXAM.

Hands down nicest professor, but don't expect generous grading.",William Lincoln ,Economics department
 GOV20,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Probably my favorite professor! Lots of great readings for the class- no textbook, which makes class very interesting.

I cannot recommend a professor more.",Charles Kesler ,Government department
 MATH032,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,A-,No,"Nelson lectures really quietly and kinda covers the whiteboard while he writes.

 GOV20,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof Lynch is good for Gov20. 3 midterms (45% total) and 2 papers (45%, 3rd paper is optional) and 10% for participation. He's a fair grader, and gives you feedback on papers if you send them to him before the deadline. Midterms are open-book, so you have to do the reading properly. Class can get repetitive but he takes attendance!",Frederick Lynch ,Government department
 ECON136,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,Yes,"This prof is so familiar of the complex topics that I feel he doesn't know how to explain these concepts to novices. In a class as technical as this one, it would have been helpful to understand the intuition behind things, or have more opportunities for exposure to problems outside of the exam and few textbook problems he recommends.",Fan Yu ,Accounting department
 ECON050,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Econ 50 was a tough class, especially when it came to tests.

You have to work hard for a good grade but you definitely learn a lot.",Mary Evans ,Economics department
 HIST100,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Shes really sweet and understanding. I loved having her as a professor. Her honors course has a lot of reading, but you only meet once a week so that was really nice.

 BIO143,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,B,No,"Prof Ferree is very nice, but that doesn't mean he's a good prof. His lectures are very disorganized and his grading style is that he doesn't give feedback.

He is unpredictable and can put students to sleep with his monotone voice.",Patrick Ferree ,Biology department
 FREN033,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"I'm surprised Bana has so many good reviews. Maybe it's just Zoom, but she was very disorganized (repeatedly forgot about tests and rescheduled them to weeks we had other projects in her class due, didn't reply to messages, forgot to tell us about homework).

 FHS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof Kalb was the highlight of my semester, she's the best! She's extremely kind and you can tell she really cares for her students and the content she's teaching.

Her essays can be tough but worth it!",Emma Kalb ,History department
 GOV70,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"A great professor and an even better person. AMAZING at facilitating discussion (even online!). She explains theory very clearly and uses lots of varied examples.

 MATH151,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Professor did an amazing job adapting his class to an online format while classes were forced to be remote because of the pandemic.

 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"This class was fairly straightforward, but since 3 non-cumulative exams were each 30% of your grade, messing up on an exam would cost you a lot.

She is also funny!",Saman Olfati ,Economics department
 PHYS33,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,Very challenging class and requires a lot of outside class time. The lectures in class are very hard to follow and I spent most of the classes just waiting for the two hours to be over.

 PHYS033,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"My favorite professor at CMC by far -- he was very extremely helpful in office hours, explained material with utmost clarity, and made sure to drill a topic in your head instead of mindlessly moving on.

You'll have to read tons of books, but they are interesting and the Prof. makes the books and class discussions truly interesting. If you like tales of heroes or ancient stories or Lord of the Rings, this will be the best class you'll ever take.",shane Bjornlie ,History department
 LIT038,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Amazing fiction writing professor who helped me significantly improve my own work. He was completely unpretentious and collaborative during our workshops, and made suggestions to my writing as a peer rather than an instructor, which was amazing because he is a successful and established writer himself.",Kevin Moffett ,Literature department
 PHIL032,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Rajczi is an awesome professor and an awesome guy. He's deeply empathetic for student concerns and is always willing to take feedback.

The primer is a godsend and will 100% boost your grade in the class",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department
 PSYC040,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,"I thoroughly enjoyed Professor Umanath's cognitive psychology class. She is super enthusiastic about the subject and makes class interesting and fun.

Get ready to work, and don't shy away from participating.",Sharda Umanath ,Psychology department
 GOV156,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof. Taw's classes will make you work for your grade, but it's so worth it. This class had a ton of opportunities for independent research, so you come out of the class with a way deeper understanding of the material than you might get from a lecture. Prof. Taw is the best, 100% would take more classes with her.",Jennifer Taw ,Government department
 LIT68,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,"Very witty professor who made me enjoy Shakespeare, something I never thought I would enjoy reading and learning about. The class atmosphere is very mellow and discussion based. Definitely one of the better classes I've taken at CMC.",Seth Lobis ,Literature department
 CHEM14L,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,"Chem14 itself is extremely rigorous and time-consuming, but Professor Huyhn does an exceptional job of explaining the concepts in multiple different ways.

 FWS010,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"She grades super tough and also forces students to write in support of things like the existence of patriarchy. I believe patriarchy does exist to an extent, but to force students to write a paper supporting the existence of it goes against my instincts of respect for other people's perspectives on the world. My classmates felt uncomfy about it....",Megan Gallagher ,Literature department
 PHIL034,4.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Kind, genuine professor who gives plenty of opportunities for extra credit. Readings are contemporary and applicable to modern day society, which is especially handy considering ""moral and political issues."" Only drawback is he assigns reading responses for every class due in the middle of the day, the day before class- so it's fairly inconvenient",Joseph Frigault ,Philosophy department
 LIT063,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Literally one of the most (if not THE most!!) kindest, caring professors at CMC.

Amazing individual and extremely sharp professor.",John Meany ,Speech department
 CSCI040,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,"Don't take CS40 as your Math GE. It is not an intro class, you need heavy coding knowledge.

He made me want to continue college spanish!",Salvador Velazco ,Modern Languages department

 PHIL030,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,B-,No,"VERY RIGID. I wouldn't recommend unless you're well read in philosophy. She seems to have a one track mind for right and wrong answers, and is not open to philosophical interpretations. She also doesn't give much to explain or help with understanding and seems to push harder when a topic is difficult. She is not nurturing, and not very open.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 PHIL95,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof Kind knows her stuff, and is great at teaching it. The unfortunate thing is it seems people either get logic or they don't.

Overall, I really enjoyed the class, liked logic and proofs, and would take it again.",Amy Kind ,Philosophy department
 MATH060C,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof Kao is great. While remote, she held multiple office hours every week to help with homework, and was super accessible outside of class.

 CHEM116,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,"Professor Mackey is great! This semester, his class stayed as a flip classroom. This still worked for me because in person, you do a lot of word problems which makes the readings and videos clearer and gives you a sense of how exam questions will look. Hes also good at explaining things and actually has humor.",Joel Mackey ,Chemistry department
 FHS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Professor Uvin is great! I really enjoyed his class and it was most definitely the best class I took this semester!

Also, make sure to talk to him outside class.",Peter Uvin ,Government department

She really wants you to succeed, but the exams count for way too much and are often graded pretty harshly.",Jennifer Feitosa ,Psychology department
 PHIL038,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Readings every night, then a quiz on them in class. You have seven attempts to complete 4 writing assignments, all different.

 SPAN033,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Learning is done ONLY for homework and is barely reviewed in class which is not only not accessible for a lot of students, but also leaves every student in a different spot.

Pitney ,Government department
 MATH131,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Do not take. She is a very nice person but not a good teacher. All these reviews are saying her lectures are unclear but that's ok?

 SPAN044,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof Gonzales' class is the most fun class I've had so far. He assigns lots of textbook activities and small assignments for homework each day, so make sure to stay on top of that, but then you're fine. No final, just 2 big noncumulative midterms.

 FWS010,4.0,2.0,Yes,No,A,Yes,"The course's structure seemed perfect for FWS: we would write 750+word pieces every week and then discuss them in class. Prof Schur's feedback is sometimes not supported by anyone else, which is confusing, but he doesn't consider it to be the only right one, so it's fine. Papers weren't graded - just write them, attend classes, and you'll get an A.",Thomas Schur ,Literature department
 MATH55,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,C+,No,"Prof cannon is a really great professor! Her lectures are clear and she explains things really well. I took her for discrete.

The homework readings were way too much and not realistic at all, but you can get through the class without reading much.

 HIST163,2.5,2.0,,,,No,"Modern Chinese History could've been a great course, but Rosenbaum was just so boring and, above all, disorganized. He rambled on and on without really saying anything, and he strayed off the syllabus for weeks without being aware of it. Nice guy, and obviously knowledgeable. Perhaps his teaching skills declined as he aged, which is too bad.",Arthur Rosenbaum ,History department
 BIO44,5.0,1.0,,,,,"Every other word out of his mouth is ""ummmmm"" other than that he's really easy, ulta tight and way out there...go Bio!",Donald McFarlane ,Biology department
 BIO43,1.0,3.0,,,,,"SO BORING.  She writes heaps on the board, but it's impossible to retain anything or stay awake.  Still, she lectures better than some other intro bio profs.  Save yourself and take Sadava.",Robin Justice ,Biology department
 PHIL090,4.5,2.0,Yes,,Rather not say,Yes,"Amazing discussion leader, emphasizes what is most important. Very engaging and never bores you. You should never worry if you encounter difficult concepts in the reading, because he gives great explanations in class. A few papers, some simple assignments, and a final. Overall it is an easy intro class, but you learn a lot. ",Jefferson Huang ,Philosophy department
 ECON86,3.0,4.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Lectures are boring, and can be skipped. He puts in the effort to learn his students' names. Very nice, smart professor. 5 quizzes throughout the semester  too many.",Joshua Rosett ,Economics department
 MATH030,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"For your health and sanity... Don't take a class with this professor. She is just not a very intelligent person who is no where near being grounded in reality. Too put it simply, she is a bad teacher. If you have taken calculus before then you are a better teacher than she is.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department
 BIOL44,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Lectures are really clear. Hard to raise your grade especially if you're not a great test-taker.,Marion Preest ,Biology department
 BIO43L,3.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"She's pretty terrible. Assigned at least 50 pages of reading in the textbook each week. Doesn't curve her tests, even though everyone failed the second one. Exams are extremely difficult and she likes to pick random buried facts from the text and test you on them. Avoid at all costs.",Gretchen Edwalds-Gilbert ,Biology department
 GOV125,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Extremely kind, very invested in student learning and well-being! The class is almost entirely discussion based, but Professor Spalding steps in when necessary. I would disagree with previous comments; I cannot tell which way Spalding swings politically. I will say that she is not an easy grader, though.",Elizabeth Spalding ,Government department
 CELLBIO,2.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"she is super friendly and passionate, but she does not explain things well at all and her lectures were completely disorganized. Even though i was really excited for the class, she did everything but destroy my interest in cell bio. I love her as a person but she is probably the worst prof ive had at JSD. dont take cell bio with her",Irene Tang ,Biology department
 LIT000,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,great professor. Engaging discussions. Has a great background and is doing some really neat things. Hard grader and I agree that if you go to his office hours it helps because it then that you know what he wants and/or expects from you.,Adam Bradley ,Literature department
 GOVT125,4.0,3.0,,,,No,Extraordinarily engaging. Loved going to his class. Great speaker. No outside reading required.,John Haskell ,Government department
 HIST120,5.0,2.0,,,,,"Great classes. The class did sometimes feel like a book club meeting instead of a history class. If Yoo would take a more active role in leading the discussion, it would be an amazing class. Yoo's comments are always helpful, and he structures his assignments to make sure his students do well. I can't wait to take another class with in him.",David Yoo ,History department
 PYSCH140,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Probably the coolest, most awesome, prof i have had at cmc.  Class wasn't to hard and he made it very easy to make it through a 3 hour seminar.  I would recommend him to anyone and after taking his class I am now making him my advisor.",Jay Conger ,Psychology department
 HIST130,4.5,2.0,,,,,"Only one paper makes up pretty much your entire grade, so it kinda makes it hard to want to go to class, since it'll have no effect on your grade except for the little participation and weekly summaries.  But he's super funny, giggles, brings us food, and is overall very interesting.",Robert Kirkland ,History department
 PSYCH30,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"our class was about 40 people, so lecture style and class size was enough that she knew our names but not enough to become close with the teacher. is a good lecturer, but some lectures straight from textbook and not very engaging. she is an easy grader on projects, homework, and essay portion of test, but multiple choice is hard. watch out!",Diane Halpern ,Psychology department
 ECON134,3.5,5.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,No,she is for those who willing to devote much efforts. a lot of time required to prepare for each and every class. class is designed in a way if you dont put into work you learn nothing. she teaches great but very demanding class,Lisa Meulbroek ,Economics department
 GOV20,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"It's really cool to know he worked in gov for a long time. However, it is very difficult to speak your mind in that class, especially if you are a liberal (he will burn easily you miserably). It was always hilarious seeing a student from Harvey Mudd try to attack him with his overconfident comments but the prof always knew how to control him.",Michael Uhlmann ,Government department
 FHS10,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,B-,No,"DO NOT TAKE FOR FHS! The absolute worst professor I have ever had. Assigns an absurd amount of reading, reflections every week (which she grades very harsh), following the prompt on essays is not enough. No readings or films from this century (assigns a french film). Does not provide helpful insight, all she does is mediate discussions. Horrible.",Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department
 COS126,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,Terrible at explaining concepts- instead talks about his personal life. Subjective as can be.,Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 RS1,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,He is very passionate about his field. I strongly recommend this class.,Kjell Lejon ,Government department
 BIO44,4.0,2.0,,,,No,Guthrie is AMAZING!!! One should invest in this course. Although his methods are strange he is a phenomenal teacher and I would not take another professor given the chance. You learn without actually realizing it.,Dan Guthrie ,Biology department
 ECON102,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"Avoid this class if you can; you will get graded unfairly on questions that are completely unclear. Lectures are very confusing and though he stressed the importance of writing down everything he writes, there are never complete sentences or clear diagrams on the board.",Sven Arndt ,Economics department
 BIO43,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Very nice and helpful teacher!,Emily Wiley ,Biology department
 PE110,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"Overall, class is pretty ""Rad"".",David Hamilton ,Physical Education department
 SPAN33,5.0,3.0,,,,No,Great teacher. She forces you to speak spanish in her class. If you attend all her classes and try you will be rewarded with a better grasp of the language and an A. Highly recommend her.,Maria Martinez ,Modern Languages department
 PSYC070,4.5,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,"My favourite professor at CMC! Always willing to help students. He wants you to do well and is always in a good mood. Also, he brings his super cute dog to class!",Wei-Chin Hwang ,Psychology department
 140,3.5,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,"A lot of students seemed to find this class boring, but I thought it was super interesting.  If you don't do the readings, it will seem boring and random.  If you do the readings, it will seem quite relevant to what's happening in the world today.  You will get out of this class what you put into it.  ",Graham Bird ,Economics department
 AISS1B,3.5,1.0,Yes,,,No,Professor Coleman is super sweet and always brings her dog Elmer to class. She is super passionate about biology and neuroscience but sometimes her lectures can be a bit unclear. She definitely cares about all her students!,Melissa Coleman ,Biology department
 ECON154,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,One of the most knowledgeable teachers at CMC. Class will be difficult at times but very in depth and you will learn a ton. Very helpful in office hours and wants students to learn.,George Batta ,Economics department
 SPAN033,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,Profesora Wall tried her best with an 8 am class. She's kind of a hard grader. She is very goofy and really stresses participation in class. the more you talk the better you will do.,Catherine Wall ,Modern Languages department
 CIV10,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"I wish that Aimaq could teach the bulk of my classes at CMC.  She is amazing: EXTREMELY intelligent, witty, hilarious,understanding...  It takes a lot for a teacher to be able to teach you SO much, whilst letting the class run the discussion.  We watch great clips, too! On top of teaching us so much, she jokes and has fun. Very, very fair grader.",Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department
 BIO43,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"She comes across as a really nice lady. Don't let the smile fool you. She believes that everyone took AP Bio when we all didn't. Overall, she's an average teacher but I would not take her again. She is always available outside of class. Although that doesn't mean that she will help you fully comprehend the material. It's up 2 you. Read the book tho",Jennifer Armstrong ,Biology department
 PHIL30,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"his notes are definitely clear, but it is not enough to do well on tests because they are more like outlines. his tests are tricky (watch out for the true/false) and go in to see him about papers. although i think his tests are unfair, he is an energetic and all around great prof.",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department
 CS135,3.5,2.0,Yes,,A,No,"Need to learn htmlcss, javascript (and jquery), php, and ajax. If you can do this and do simple programs with them, then its an easy A. He gives extensions for homework (there weren't many homework assignments) easily. Not super clear, but if you go to him he will tell you what he wants. Has many examples, use them when you do homework.",Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department
 ECON102,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,He rocks,Brock Blomberg ,Economics department
 FHS10,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Although at times the class was disorganized and had a lot of work, she is an extremely caring woman and if you get to know her (go to her office hours!) she will be very helpful. She assigns a lot of reading but you don't have to truly do it. I really liked her as a professor and think she is very caring about her students",Nita Kumar ,History department
 LIT2,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Leal starts out a little strange and ends the class leaving you with a taste for old literature like you never thought you'd have.  At first the class is unbelievable because of the seemingly ""useless"" work to do... but later in the semester when one is swamped with midterms, this class is the only one with a reasonable workload.",Amy Leal ,Literature department
 CALC030,1.5,5.0,,,,No,"Do not take her class at all costs. Average grades on both mid-terms were failing and more than half the class dropped. If you end up in the class dont take it, wait a semester.",Andrea Jedwab ,Mathematics department
 SPAN44,2.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Spanish 44 was fine. Skinner is a busy prof- she has kids, other classes, and is in charge of the Fulbright scholarship stuff at CMC and 44 seemed pretty low priority to her. She missed a lot of her office hours and could not offer supplementary materials when I needed help. The class is easy to get an A in without doing the reading",Lee Skinner ,Modern Languages department
 CALC31,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,German doesn't waste your time. He spends each class using five minutes to teach new material (much clearer than the textbook) and spends the rest of the time on example problems. HW is 1.5 hrs due once a week and mid-terms are five reasonable problems. German will give 1-1 tutoring if you come during office hours.,David German ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"DO NOT TAKE HER CLASS if you think you'll learn anything. Her class is simple in terms of how she teaches BUT if you are not self-motivated, you will do really bad on her midterms. I admit I didn't try too hard in her class but I really regret taking her class. At least I would have learned something in another Econ class, even if I get a low grade",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department
 BIO43,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"She is an absolutely horrible teacher. Questions in class were answered in the most roundabout way possible and her grading simply doesn't make sense. For example, the average on one test was approximately 69, I got a 63, which was graded as an F. I recommend against taking her.",Amy Chow ,Biology department
 ECON50,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Great guy, reasonable workload, and a fair grader. I loved this class even though he got off subject all the time. Would definitely recommend.",E Aksoy ,Economics department

 ECON196,5.0,4.0,Yes,,B,Yes,"196 is a very challenging course but Professor Shelton makes students want to succeed. He will meet with students at all times of the day, and furthermore help teach me some programming skills and gave interview prep for some macroeconomic based questions",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department
 ECN233,2.5,3.0,,,,No,Not a great class. Material is delivered in a very boring fashion.,Eric Hughson ,Economics department

 GOV60,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Pei is so awesome. He is very clear and an excellent teacher. He has tons of expertise on everything he teaches. I would recommend 10000000%! He is great for Comp Gov, East Asian Political Economy and Chinese Politics.",Minxin Pei ,Government department
 SPAN102,2.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"She is a very nice woman who has a lot of pasion for spanish but this class was a pain. SO much busy work and unclear expectations. Had a big group project and essay due right after Thanksgiving with little guidelines until the day before, practically. This class almost turned me off from being a spanish major because it was so boring and vague.",Raquel Vega-Duran ,Modern Languages department
 LIT010,4.5,1.0,,,,Yes,Very nice teacher! We read a lot of pretty interesting books and he was very helpful with coming up with topics to write about for essays. Not a huge workload and a very fair grader.,Ryan Carhart ,Literature department
 CHEM101L,5.0,1.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,He is the best professor I had ever. I like him so much because he is very polite and respectable. He is always available to answer your questions. I would really like to attend his class again. He is gentle professor. Having acgentle professor like him is a chance for me  and will be for you too!,Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department
 CHEM15,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,She is so helpful during office hours. She does have a unique way of teaching though that might not be for everybody. She wants nothing more than for her students to excel. She is a great professor.,Kayla Kaiser ,Chemistry department
 ECON134,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Cares about and wants to build a relationship with each and every of his students. Also really cares about fairness between students. Makes the boring topic of corporate finance bearable at his worst, and actually quiet interesting at his best. Gives you a lot of real life advice, too. Makes you work for an A.",Murat Binay ,Economics department
 PHIL033,5.0,4.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,"Schroeder is the best philosophy prof. Took him for Political Philosophy and we had interesting lectures, papers, and discussions. He really does know how to properly teach philosophy and interpret really dense material - go to office hours with friends and you'll get the most out of it!",Andrew Schroeder ,Philosophy department
 GOV70,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Fabbe is great -- and if you are thinking of Middle Eastern studies, taking a class with her is a MUST. The class is mostly centered around security-studies, grounded in IR theory. Classes require a fair amount of preparation and exams require tons of studying. Rewarding nonetheless.",Kristin Fabbe ,Government department
 FWS,5.0,4.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Take this class if you want to think deeply and become a better reader/writer. The readings for this class were powerful, and I found myself going to office hours very often just to have long conversations with Leland (and to pet Bear, his dog). Leland is REALLY smart and interesting, and his attention to detail is far above that of mere mortals.",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department
 PHIL30,5.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Prof Yang is awesome! He's super knowledgeable, clear, and fair. I highly recommend him for an intro to phil class. We discussed abortion, existence of God, personal identity, etc.",Eric Yang ,Philosophy department
 FWS10,3.5,1.0,Yes,,A,Yes,Professor Kindley is a good FWS professor. He assigns a very reasonable amount of work and gives pretty good feedback on essays. The class was relatively easy and had some interesting books.,Evan Kindley ,Literature department
 MATH60,5.0,1.0,Yes,,,Yes,"I have took three of his courses including Math303160. The lecture is well-structured and the notes are clear and really help you prepare for the exams. If you don't want to spend too much time on these courses, take him. ",David Krumm ,Mathematics department
 HIST113,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"This class changed my life. She is SO focussed and helpful, and has a clear direction when it comes to how she wants the semester to progress, with a really good balance of discussions, lectures, papers and a three-class simulation at the end of the semester that replaces the final paper. Class is challenging but worth it. Highly recommend her.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department
 ECON101,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,B+,No,"She's by far the worst prof I've had here.  As somebody who is really interested in econ, i've been able to power through but i have multiple friends who have dropped econ as part of their dual major after taking this class.",Oana Tocoian ,Economics department
 CHEM15,4.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Tests are hard -- but he will go over anything you need help on and genuinely wants students to succeed! The class got painstakingly boring towards the end, but I will credit that to the material, not to him.",Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department
 MATH052,2.0,3.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,Wasn't the biggest fan.  Math dept @ CMC is definitely weak.  Seems to care significantly more about her research than helping students.  Not very helpful with questions b/c she assumes you know what you're talking about (which is clearly not the case if I'm asking a question).  Was disappointed to find a teacher like this at CMC.,Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department
 ECON086,1.5,4.0,,,A-,Yes,"His lectures don't contribute to the tested material at all. He likes to talk about accounting and its uses, but rarely teaches the fundamentals and expects you to be able to complete the homework by learning the material yourself. For someone not familiar with accounting, this was a very difficult and frustrating class.",Douglas McEachern ,Accounting department
 CS51,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Great intro class. He doesn't try to make his lectures super exciting, but if you're interested in the material like I was it should be pretty interesting. At the very least his lectures are very informative and easy to follow. He's incredibly helpful and will always try to answer any questions you have.",John Sun ,Computer Science department
 ECON120,4.5,3.0,,,,No,Very nice and approachable. Office hours are super helpful. Willing to listen to students' feedback and make amendments. Might give some tricky questions in exams but fair overall.,Jungmo Yoon ,Economics department
 CHEM116,4.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Stanton is a nice lady - she is willing to help if you ask and come to office hours, and she has her problem solving sessions which are very helpful for the exams. However, she can go very quickly in her lectures and I had to watch supplementary videos just to catch up to the material. Study the practice exam!!",Gretchen Stanton ,Chemistry department
 LIT097,4.5,4.0,,,A,Yes,"This is my first review ever, and I have to do it because Professor Stergiopoulos is an inspiration!!! She is SO smart and lovely.  Could not recommend her enough.  So knowledgable in her field.",Kathryn Stergiopoulos ,Literature department
 FWS101,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,He's amazingly intelligent and can give you a new insight toward poems and literature even though you used to not have a particular interest. He might not be a type of person who can give you a good impression in the first day of his class and might give you a feeling that he's kind of an awkward guy. But be patient; HIS CLASS IS DANG WORTH IT,Giulio Pertile ,Literature department
 ECON150,4.5,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,Very clear lectures. Thoroughly explains everything. No curveballs on tests. Overall a really nice guy.,Peter Bergevin ,Economics department

 MATH151,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,A,Yes,"Professor Hunter is among the sweetest, most caring, and supportive professors I have ever had. Though he has tough tests and quizzes, his homework assignments are reasonable. His lectures oftentimes cover too many things in such a short time that it may be overwhelming, but if you work hard and come in and see him, you will be able to do just fine",Blake Hunter ,Mathematics department
 HIST100,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,"IMPORTANT: We did not receive a single assignment or grade back this entire semester. Although Professor Hopper is extremely articulate, he is extremely condescending (which discourages participation). It is also impossible to participate if you are not one of Hopper's few favorites. Do yourself a favor find a more professional professor. BE WARNED",Ian Hopper ,History department
 CHEM116,5.0,4.0,Yes,,B,Yes,"Professor Dashaputre is the teacher you want for Organic Chemistry. She is helpful and open to spending time with you individually if you are struggling in any way, however, that being said the class is difficult as you would expect and the tests (while similar to the practice exams) are about 4x as hard.",Neeraja Dashaputre ,Chemistry department
 CHEM014L,4.0,3.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,"He gives daily class quizzes so you can't really skip a class.  He's really approachable and loves when people ask questions. He is open for  extra scheduled office hours which is helpful if your schedule does not permit you to attend his set hours. Super nice. Tests are general, definitely study as you learn type of class.",Cameron Iverson ,Chemistry department
 BIO43,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Such a fun class but I had to work really hard for the A. Definitely pushes you and is a very tough professor. But he brings out the best in you. He's a very caring professor and wants all of you to succeed so don't be afraid to ask him for help if you're struggling in his class.,Joseph Cohen ,Biology department
 ECON125,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"She's super knowledgable in econometrics and data analysis (and loves it). We covered a lot of material, but she explains things in a way that is easy to grasp. Lectures are fun - half are computer exercises. Highly recommend this class and Prof. Vossmeyer.",Angela Vossmeyer ,Economics department
 HIST132,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,"Prof. Lower is one of those professors who, if you show that you care, come to class, and seek her feedback in office hours, you will have made a lifelong relationship with an inspirational mentor. She is highly knowledgeable and provides opportunities for students to attend talks and events outside which are always WELL WORTH the time! Love her!",Wendy Lower ,History department
 HIST052,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A+,No,"Professor Cooper is sincerely my favorite professor that I have ever taken. He is the most caring and understanding educator that I have ever had the opportunity to learn beneath. If you put in the effort, you will get an A in this class. He is wonderful during office hours and truly has a passion for what he is teaching. TAKE THIS CLASS!!",Glen Cooper ,History department
 CHEM177,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,"Very specific on answers, she's not very generous on partial credit, you either know it all the way or you don't. If she's the only option and you're  chem major or biochem major you'll do fine, if you're like me and need it for major requirement, make some friends in the class",Arlie Rinaldi ,Chemistry department
 CHEM14,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"Professor Hurlocker is by far my favorite professor. She has an energy that radiates throughout the class and deeply cares about her students and their understanding of chemistry. Her lectures are typically a summary of the textbook, which can get boring at times, but she does problems in front of the class that really help to cement understanding.",Brisa Hurlocker ,Chemistry department
 GOV020,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"I loved my government class with Professor Pears so much that I switched my major. Although she assigned a ton of reading, her class was so interesting and worth it. There are pop quizzes throughout the semester but she gives partial credit and is very lenient with grades as long as you do the reading and participate in class.",Emily Pears ,Government department
 PHIL036,4.0,3.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,No,"Some confusing and difficult readings for class, but he goes over them thoroughly and is very understanding and caring.

 BIOL43,4.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Holt was a great lab professor, and a decent lecturer. He genuinely cares for his students and I found his office hours very helpful. However, I felt his slide content was insufficient to prepare for exams despite him saying so, and needed to refer to the textbook to fully understand the course, although I know other student who disagree with me.",Jonathan Holt ,Biology department
 CSCI55,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"One of my favorite professors at CMC. Necessary to go to every class and pay attention because he gives detailed lectures, but he lets the class out early almost every time. He can be unorganized at times so make sure to ask for the printed lecture notes. He is very responsive to students, caring, and straight forward about test material",Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department
 BIO43,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,Bio 43 with Prof Nagel was really great. I 100% recommend you take her class if you are ready to work hard. She's so funny and is really smart. I learned so many fun facts in her class.,Anastasia Nagel ,Biology department
 HIST059,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I learned a lot from Prof Wang; she is extremely knowledgeable about what she teaches. As an intro course, the grading was pretty formulaic. If you do the reading, you can easily do well. Her lectures were very informative and interesting enough to keep me engaged. She always came off as nervous when lecturing, but I think that's just how she is.",Chelsea Wang ,History department
 BIO44,1.0,1.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"People often joke about easy professors who don't do anything, but this is taken to an entire other level. Gilbert's lectures don't properly cover the material at all. Class is easy, but you won't learn anything. I don't fear for my grade based on her performance, but because of her sheer incompetence in corrections, entering grades etc. Total joke",Princess Gilbert ,Biology department
 ECON125,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Love Ben Gillen. This man is so funny (dressed up once to match his bitmoji), and the class grading criteria is pretty relaxed. More than anything he just wants you to learn, and won't make condescending remarks if you don't get something like some other profs. Such an awesome teacher. Lets you have a notes sheet to bring for the midterms too.",Benjamin Gillen ,Economics department
 CALC32H,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Wong is awesome! She is easily one of (if not my absolute) favorite professors on campus.

On top of all this, she is a genuinely nice and caring person!",Helen Wong ,Mathematics department
 PHIL34,4.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Professor Basu is creates a really casual atmosphere and does a good job moderating discussions. She's also probably one of the funniest professors I have ever had.,Rima Basu ,Philosophy department
 ECON192,5.0,4.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"I took Professor Taylor for both Business Law and Tax, and he is hands down, one of my favorite professors at CMC.  It's not an easy class, and you WILL have to read in order to do well, but Prof. Taylor truly cares about his students inside and outside his classroom.  Show up to class or your grade will suffer, even if you do well on the tests.",James Taylor ,Accounting department
 BIOL131,2.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Horribly unhelpful throughout lectures, lab, and just about everything else. He doesn't even seem to have a clear grasp of the material he teaches, so don't expect to learn much or get answers whenever you have a question. Tests were easy and straightforward, but it still doesn't help when he teaches you next to nothing and expects you to know it.",Jason Borchert ,Biology department
 GOV20,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,I really enjoyed Professor Thomas' Gov20 class this semester. It's a lot of reading but definitely worth it. He's one of the smartest professors I know and always willing to help. I learnt so much throughout the class and would absolutely recommend taking it!,George Thomas ,Government department
 ECON101,4.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"This class was great. Flory is a great teacher and makes you really understand the concepts. The tests are not hard, you just have to go over the problem sets. Flory grades really easy on exams as well, he does not dock off a lot of points for incorrect math.

 HIST146,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I've taken him twice now and loved every minute of it. He's a gem of a man and a professor. He made me change my major to history.

Also, has an obsession with Harvard.",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department

The homework and cases are fair and don't take too much time.", Andrew Finley ,Economics department
 CHEM014,2.5,1.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,No,"The midterms and final for this class are so easy. He literally gives you a ""study guide"" that will look very very very similar to the test so take it very seriously and try to learn exactly what's on it.

 ECON050,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof Ozbeklik is really nice and tries hard to make the class engaging. I personally hate econ, and doing this online was tough.

One of my few profs who sticks to syllabus!",Serkan Ozbeklik ,Economics department
 ECON101,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,The class attendance was optional and every day was just lectures never did worksheets or activities (so it was boring).

Basically, its all lecture.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 GOV020,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"I took this class as a prerequisite for law classes, and this professor is great.

Assigns weekly pre-class quizzes.",Mary Evans ,Economics department
 HIST100,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"The most caring, kind, and considerate professor ever.

 FREN002,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Professor Dahi is undoubtedly one of the best teachers I've ever had.

I can't recommend her enough.,Bana Dahi ,Modern Languages department
 GOVT020,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Well-respected prof at CMC. His classes are all lecture/discussion-based. He is very clear about each important topic and will go into extreme detail about them.

Take a class with Prof. Koch.",Lisa Koch ,Government department
 GOV60,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Appel is the best professor I've had at CMC. She is extremely passionate about political economy.

The work is manageable and none of it is busy work.",Hilary Appel ,Government department
 GOV20,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Professor Courser is quite knowledgeable about government and policy, making his class fun for any novice to amateur level political junky.

Highly recommend him.",James Morrison ,Literature department
 GOV141,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Terril is the most hands-on teacher I've ever had. Classes are full of anecdotes from his 20+ years of experience as a journalist, amazing guest lecturers and the AP Stylebook.

Although the class was very easy, I learned a lot and would recommend her!",Saman Olfati ,Economics department
 PHYS33,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof Wells really cared about his students and their understanding of the topic.

Hard class but you just have to put in the effort.",James Wells ,Physics department
 PHYS035,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Great online teaching, lectures are clear and interesting, relevant to homework, answers questions well.

I learned a lot, even though the class was online this semester.",Kevin Setter ,Physics department
 CHEM040L,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"This class was incredibly difficult. The professor was knowledgeable, but when going to his office hours he was patronizing. He made it clear he was way smarter than you and not very helpful.",Aaron Leconte ,Chemistry department
 HIST119,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Selig is one of the most genuine, caring professors I've ever had.

 LIT134,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I took his Spy Films class and really enjoyed it. The movie choices are solid and we discussed them in class, which I loved.

 ECON101,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Avoid at all costs! She is nice enough in class but from the constant assessments and textbook reading, that she grades undyingly strict, she makes the class unbearable.

You should save yourself the pain.",Laura Grant ,Economics department
 ECON135,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"If you come to EVERY class you will get all the material you need to ace the tests.

 PSYC030,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"One of the worst profs I've had at CMC. Very unhelpful at office hours and via email - for most of the short essays, you have to guess her grading criteria. Very picky with her grading and has prompts that are too open ended. If asked for specifications, she answers vaguely. Super frustrating to have, but you get out of class early most days",Tomoe Kanaya ,Psychology department
 HIST144,3.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Geismer is one of my favorite professors at CMC! I took her Reagan Era history class which obviously discussed Reagan and his policies, but looked more broadly at the culture of the 1980s as well.

 FWS030,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Moffett is amazing. His class is not only interesting, but he really taught me to be a better writer this semester.

 PHIL032,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Best class I've taken at CMC. Convinced me to become a Phil major.

 PSYC040,4.0,4.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,"The material of the cognitive class is interesting and the class is organised. But her grading is unnecessarily hard, and all midterms are cummulative. I would not recommend to take this as a GE, altough it does not require intro to psych.",Sharda Umanath ,Psychology department
 GOV70H,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Taw is what I came to CMC for. She's an incredibly knowledgeable professor, which sometimes leads her to lecture quite quickly, but I've learned an insane amount from her. She is one of the main reasons I decided to stay in the IR major. She's a tough grader, but if you go to office hours, it's very manageable. 100% would recommend!",Jennifer Taw ,Government department
 LIT057,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Lobis is delightfully sassy and articulate (his speaking is more precise than most writing). You do need to participate, but he's very forgiving if you make dumb comments during discussion. Moderately tough grader for papers imo, non-literature majors may have a tough time. Don't take Brit lit for a GE, take Shakespeare or Milton with him",Seth Lobis ,Literature department
 CHEM14,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B,No,Prow Huynh is great but chem14 in Keck is horrible especially with the flipped classroom curriculum.

 PHIL034,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof. Frigault is super interesting and he made our 8am worth getting up for. Before each class, you have a 10-20 page reading and you answer 4 questions (2-3 sentences each) about what you found interesting + questions you have about the reading. The class is discussion-based so there are lots of opportunities to participate. Definitely recommend!",Joseph Frigault ,Philosophy department
 LIT57,5.0,3.0,,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof Rentz is such a lovely person. She truly cares about her students and reassesses the class workload based on student feedback.

 CHEM15,5.0,2.0,,,,No,"Very nice and clear throughout lectures. Her tests are challenging, but they are very fair. Didn't use textbook much apart from problem sets.

Great person and Prof for a religious GE.",Chloe Martinez ,Religious Studies department

Overall a solid choice though",Bhaven Mistry ,Mathematics department

 MATH030,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Professor Valenza is a great professor. He really cares for his students and knows how to teach Calculus. He constantly stops and makes sure that everyone understands what he is teaching. Tests were very easy and he was very clear about what he expected. He is hilarious and his personality definitely lights up the class on Fridays. Solid professor.,Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department

 ECON150,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,"Magilke is definitely one of the hardest professors at CMC and while he makes you study a lot on your own, it forces you to learn accounting. Tests are tough, but if you study in advance and put in the work, you'll get the grade you deserve. He's accessible during office hours and although can be intimidating, will answers your questions.",Matthew Magilke ,Accounting department

 GOVT020,5.0,3.0,,Yes,A,Yes,"You'll have to read a lot, but all the readings are chosen exceptionally well and, mostly, give you a fair representation of different sides' arguments. Prof Muravchik is very kind, caring, and accomodating. You can easily get an A without any background knowledge about American Politics if you read carefully and ask for help if necessary.",Stephanie Muravchik ,Government department
 GOVT191,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"NOTE: I took this course online. Professor Busch assigns a lot of readings and a 20 page paper in addition to 5 3-page papers as part of the final. Readings generally present liberal and conservative perspectives, even though Professor Busch himself is clearly conservative. The class is difficult and a lot of work, but absolutely worth taking.",Andrew Busch ,Government department
 CALC2,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,great teacher but didnt talk about the ontological position of blackness in modern america. other than that he was a great teacher,Michael O'Neill ,Mathematics department
 CHEM116,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof Wenzel is a gem. As someone who had a tough time in Gen Chem, she has made Ochem really doable. She will bend over backwards to help her students, and goes the extra mile to make this subject bearable. However, she is a busy lady and can be somewhat inaccessible outside of O.H.. Devastated I didn't get into her class for 2nd semester.",Anna Wenzel ,Chemistry department
 KOREAN22,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"She is really kind hearted and I enjoy how she brings in historical facts and culture while teaching the language and provides good memory techniques. The class is fairly easy, but it is important to study for the quizzes and do all the homework. Practicing the conversations on your own time and during language table is helpful.Replies emails fast.",Minju Kim ,Modern Languages department
 CHEM116,1.0,1.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Do not take this course unless you don't want to learn organic chemistry. Prof Williams goes super fast and does not teach well. Tough grader gives no partial credit. Does not post any of the lectures online so if for any reason you're absent, you just missed a whole lecture. Unreasonable as well. I do not recommend taking her class.",Sierra Williams ,Chemistry department
 ACCT2,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"An incredible professor, and even a better human being. I'm eternally grateful for his help, enthusiasm, and his love and care for me as a person.

He is a genuine, caring, and a masterful  teacher.",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department
 RLST151,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,A-,No,"She gave so much busy work, seems like she chose the most random and boring lecture material possible. Felt like nothing was connected or made sense. She grades harshly with almost no feedback.",Esther Chung-Kim ,Religious Studies department
 RLST128,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"He is super knowledgeable and passionate. He is a tough grader and I worked really hard on papers and got a B+ on every one, but I ended up with an A-. Office hours are helpful and he's really nice! Readings were usually dense and long but I really enjoyed lectures and discussions.",Jamel Velji ,Religious Studies department
 PSYC037,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,"Organizational Psychology is a very interesting course. In my opinion, you can learn the whole material by reading the book and not attending any lectures. Professor Riggio is a very harsh and inconsistent grader, and somehow during the pandemic he went from giving everyone A-s to giving out Bs. So harsh! I definitely do not recommend him.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department
 GOV80,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Simply brilliant. If you argue A, he will convince you that B is correct. If you argue B, he will convince you that A is correct. Highly recommend for students willing to engage in passionate, at times 'controversial', discussions. Do not recommend for students that are 'soft' or unwilling to challenge themselves,",Christopher Nadon ,Government department
 PSYCH092,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,"Lecture Heavy, but he's an awesome lecturer.  Favorite Prof. at CMC so far.  He's funny and engaging in class and really cares about his students. It helps to have the textbook, since some test questions come from it, but tests are truly lecture-heavy. He's the best. TAKE THIS CLASS!!! :)",Piercarlo Valdesolo ,Psychology department
 LIT162,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,One of my favorite lit classes I've taken so far. The readings were really interesting and engaging. The classes were a good balance of class discussions and lectures that contextualized what we were reading. She really wants everyone's voice to be heard in class and makes it very easy to participate. Definitely hope to take more classes with her!,Marie-Denise Shelton ,Modern Languages department
 GOV130,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Professor Camp is amazing. His Mexican Gov & Politics class is a must.  He knows so much about the topic and wants his students to have fun learning. The reading is not bad at all and there are only 3 papers.,Roderic Camp ,Government department
 ECON101,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"His lectures are very helpful in understanding the material, and he'll answer any question you have with complete clarity. While a little on the boring side, he definitely knows his stuff and he does try to make class more interesting. His tests are not impossible to do well in as long as you study.",Darren Filson ,Economics department
 FR1,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Madame Young is a great teacher. She explains grammer and speaking techniques clearly. She gives daily homework. We had 3 mid-terms and a cum. final. 3 Essays, 2 of which could be rewritten. She is fun, nice and a great teacher.",Sylvie Young ,Modern Languages department
 CORE1,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"This prof is super chill and kind! He's very optimistic and helpful, responds to emails promptly and is very willing to help out during office hours.

 ECON50,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Good points: funny, interesting prof, can't tell if you miss class alot, just read the powerpoints he provides on sakai and theres no need to go to class, easy homework; Bad points: tests are HARD, be prepared to study your ass off, and doesn't know students' names",Meric Keskinel ,Economics department

 LIT1,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"She can be intimidating at times, but she's an excellent professor with a vibrant passion for literature.  She's very open to student ideas and encourages expression at every opportunity.  You must do all the reading and attend every class in order to succeed, but you'll find that you enjoy it and you will learn a great deal.",Ann Meyer ,Literature department
 GOV20,4.0,3.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"Very nice man. Writes amazing recommendations, so get to know him. Intro level gov class- His lectures could be boring at times, but hes clearly interested in the subject matter.  Participate for the debates and do the readings for the daily quizzes. An A is not impossible.",Jay Martin ,Government department
 ASTRO066,2.0,1.0,,,,No,"His lecture is interesting and isn't difficult to understand. 4 exams were all made of multiple questions, and labs are very simple.",Thomas Dershem ,Physics department
 PHIL036,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Enjoyed his class. Learned a lot. However, I thought the way he graded the exams was quite unfair & unclear to students. Not a ton of work--2 5pg papers and 2 (tough) exams.",Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department
 PSYC109,5.0,2.0,,,,No,"LOVE Professor Levin. Stats is never fun, but her lecture style was very clear and she was very accessible both during and outside of class hours. She expects a lot, but you also learn a lot.",Shana Levin ,Psychology department
 MATH31,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,Enjoyable class,Mario Martelli ,Mathematics department
 30AND65,3.5,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Arbitrary grader based off whether or not she likes you, so show up to every class, be polite, and you will get a grade in the A range.  She will put random facts from the book on her tests, so you must read it for the tests but not for class.",Marjorie Charlop-Christy ,Psychology department
 GOV20,2.5,5.0,,,B,Yes,"Charles is clearly really knowledgeable about government and history, but his incredibly high expectations and cold demeanor make it hard to enjoy the class. He doesn't encourage students to ask questions, and often seems surprised when they do. I would definitely not recommend this class.",Charles Lofgren ,Political Science department
 LABOR1,1.0,3.0,,,,Yes,She sucks. She maybe has published some econ papers but when it comes to actually explaining the material she sucks. She sucks. I did fine in her class... She has 10% participation but doesnt take attendance. There is no final and no homework. This means your grade is dependent upon what he overall opinion of you is. Which is good and bad...,Heather Antecol ,Economics department
 GOVT70,3.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"This is probably the most reading I have ever done in my life.  This class will really expand your horizons, and Haley will invest a LOT in interested students... but you need to REALLY WORK HARD for his approval - he gets to be like your dad, taking all your successes and failures very personally.",Edward Haley ,Government department
 MATH111,3.5,4.0,Yes,,B+,No,"Tells you exactly what to expect on day 1. The class seems easy because he types up notes for you to minimize work on your end, but the tests are pretty hard. A lot of work but if you stay current you should do fine. Lectures aren't very engaging, but they're only 50 minutes long. Good prof for differential equations",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 ECON102,1.0,5.0,,,,No,he is awful.,Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department
 ID109,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"I really liked the course.  We met at the end of the day and it was a great closer.  Always looked forward to Mon & Wed afternoons.  Super teacher - older than my dad, but hot.",Reed Gratz ,History department
 LIT166,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Bilger is amazing! She's a really nice person and eager to help you if you don't understand. Taking feminist theory with her was definitely a good choice. The class was mostly discussion about the text you had to read for homework, which may have gotten boring sometimes. You can ask her to help edit your essays too!",Audrey Bilger ,Literature department
 CSCI51,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Do not take this course.  If you must take CSCI 51, take it at Pomona or with Professor Lee.  Pinter-Lucke should not be teaching this course.  He is helpful in office hours but class-wise, extremely unclear.  Too many useless assignments also.  Any class where half the students drop should tell you something about the professor.",James Pinter-Lucke ,Mathematics department
 AISS1,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"She's really smart, but she assumes you have a good background in chem and goes very fast. If you get left behind you have to work very hard to keep up. A fair grader but very demanding, intimidating, and rude at times. Her labs and tests are very hard. Not a bad teacher, but not very nice.",Mary Hatcher-Skeers ,Chemistry department
 HIST164,1.0,2.0,,,,Yes,The worst teacher I've had at this school. Lectures go absolutely nowhere and use of Powerpoint is almost redundant. I guess he is willing to help outside of class but his classes are boring and a huge waste of time. He asks for opinions but shuts them down if they challenge him or does not go along with the lesson plan. Don't take his classes.,Arthur Rosenbaum ,History department
 PHIL90,5.0,1.0,,,,,"Dean Huang is a f*$&ing G.  This class kicks ass.  Everyone should be required to take it just so you realize how badass the CMC administration really is.  Plus, you've got to give the man props for his style.  Orange sunglasses and a suit without fail.",Jefferson Huang ,Philosophy department
 ECON150,2.5,3.0,,,,No,"Didn't like his teaching style. Really liked the 5 quiz system. Didn't like the online portion of the class. Professor Rosett has an odd sense of humor that can be really amusing, but is also easily distracted from the course material. Most of the learning is self-study",Joshua Rosett ,Economics department
 MATH30,1.0,3.0,,,,Yes,do not take this class. this women is possibly the worst teacher i have ever encountered.  calc and math in general will be ruined for you. it will be the worst part of your week. some kids never come to class except for the tests class is so unbearable. stay away.,Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department
 INTROBIO,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"Preest expects you to know what she has taught you, and to know it well, but not at all to a ridiculous degree.  She truly engages in the material, and gets her students to as well.  I appreciate her side stories and examples of concepts she's talking about.  Wonderful!",Marion Preest ,Biology department
 BIO43,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"really don't like her. she spends way too much time lecturing on the ""feature investigations"" from the book and doesn't even come close to covering the material in class that she should.  nice in person, but bad in lecture. her tests are too long and pretty hard. take someone else if you can for bio43, but she's probably good for upper level stuff.",Gretchen Edwalds-Gilbert ,Biology department
 GOVT125,2.0,5.0,,,,No,"I heard current students complain, so here are my thoughts from '08. The class is a waste b/c the prof doesn't actually teach. She would be ineffective even if she did, because she doesn't tolerate other opinions. She can never justify the grades she gives, and she's totally unapproachable if you have a problem with her or her class.",Elizabeth Spalding ,Government department
 CHEM177,2.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"I completely agree with another comment--she is super friendly and passionate, but she does not explain things well at all.  The best example of this is a lecture that we were told to read chapter 11 for.  It touched on topics in four different chapters, three of which the reading outline never mentioned.",Irene Tang ,Biology department
 LIT87,4.5,2.0,,,,,He's a great guy...super smooth and cool. He grades pretty hard and is picky about it too. I suggest going to his office hours and talking to him about papers...only thing i couldn't stand about him was the fact he had to mention his graduate work at Harvard every class...,Adam Bradley ,Literature department
 GOVT126,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Contrary to a few people on here, I thought Prof. Haskell's class was the best in D.C.  He's interesting, witty, and amazingly makes the budget process somewhat enjoyable to learn.  He's a tough grader, but it's objective and consistent.  The program is tough, and so is he.  You can do well if you put the effor in.",John Haskell ,Government department
 ASAMHIST,4.0,3.0,,,A,,"Although he lacks energy a lot of the time, I thought that he was very thorough in presenting the major issues within ASAM history. Also a very nice guy. If I could have, I would have taken another class (I was a senior).",David Yoo ,History department
 LEADERSHIP,5.0,3.0,,,,,"great professor. Probably the best I've had at CMC.  He has a very good reputation in his field, and completely deserves it.  Discuss case studies in class, making the learing very applicable.  He made class low stress and easy to participate with.",Jay Conger ,Psychology department
 HIST130,5.0,2.0,,,,,"He is such a cool prof- he brings cookies for every class.  He brings the topic to life, brings in guest speakers, and the class is fun.  All the MilSci kids love him too.  Decently easy class- 15-20 page paper due at end of semester.  You're graded for participation and analysis of weekly articles",Robert Kirkland ,History department
 PSYCH30,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Very professional, very smart, very good at explaining course content. It's necessary to read every page of the textbook to do well on exams. Multiple choice on the exams are KILLER if you don't read, but the essays are easy. Don't take the course to get an easy A, there is a lot of work involved. HIGHLY recommended for Psych majors.",Diane Halpern ,Psychology department
 FIN330,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Easily the greatest professor at CMC. Everything she says is gold. Demands a lot from her students, but it's worth it. Very nice and helpful when you visit her in her office. Also, her snarky comments are absolutely hilarious (and she dresses well).",Lisa Meulbroek ,Economics department
 GOV20,3.5,2.0,,,,No,"prof was not very hard. lots of reading assigned but the lectures/midterm/final had nothing to do with it.  most of his lectures were the same, and that was our midterm word for word.  Easy workload...2 5-7 page ""book reviews"" (book reports...ya know 4th grade) and 1 midterm and a final. Personally I would take him again if given the chance",Michael Uhlmann ,Government department
 FRN44,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,good professor very clear in his explanations motivates students well. I had a good result everything is perfect,Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department
 PSY40,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,A,No,"Professor Cook is so boring. He takes 30 minutes to say something that could be said in 2. I went to his office hours with 1 easy question and he talked for an hour. Also, he is very unclear about expectations for the group project (did not provide a rubric). I really do not like this man - even listening to him talk makes me frustrated.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 RLST37,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,Grett class! Great Professor!,Kjell Lejon ,Government department
 BIO62,4.5,1.0,,,,No,This class is very interesting. He gives short summaries on environmental issues that are interesting and pertain to your life! He is also very nice in office hours and answers e-mail questions right away. I recommend this prof. for non-science majors definitely. The class is interesting (short and sweet) and the labs are easy (but boring).,Dan Guthrie ,Biology department
 ECON102,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,Unhelpful during office hours and refuses to explain material. Exam questions are unclear and very vague while the answers he looks for are very specific.,Sven Arndt ,Economics department
 BIO43L,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Wiley is one of the best profs I have ever had! She is so much fun to have in class and always helpful in office hours. She also works to remember your name, which makes a huge difference. Definately take her if you can get into her class!",Emily Wiley ,Biology department
 SPAN44,3.0,4.0,,,,No,Class is more conversation and literary analysis than grammar.Great class-much more interesting and rewarding than typical Spanish 33 and 44 classes!,Maria Martinez ,Modern Languages department
 ABNORMAL,4.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Really discussion-based so prepare to participate, tests were straight-forward and fair, all you have to do is read the textbook. He knows a lot in his field and is really welcoming. The content is super interesting too. Favorite class I've taken at CMC by far",Wei-Chin Hwang ,Psychology department
 ECON50,1.5,4.0,Yes,,,No,"Graham bird is a funny brit, that is as much positive as one can say of him. His lectures are confusing, his tests are difficult and he will not help unless you ask. Even then he provides little help and going to office hours is nearly useless.",Graham Bird ,Economics department
 MOLECULARNEURO,5.0,4.0,,,Not_Sure_Yet,Yes,Great professor! Has the best personality and interesting\entertaining lectures. Very helpful in class and during office hours. Requires a lot of reading but makes sure to explain all the topics very well and keeps it interesting. Definitely take her class if you can!,Melissa Coleman ,Biology department
 ECON86,3.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Batta is one of the hardest graders I've ever had, but doesn't seem to realize it, so he challenges his student to an extent that appears to be out of his control. The class was informative and necessary for my major, but I would never take it out of pure interest or for the sake of experiencing a great professor.",George Batta ,Economics department
 SPAN22,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"The class was pretty hard and there was a ton of homework, but if you work at it, you can do well.  She is also a pretty good teacher who encourages you to contribute a lot.",Catherine Wall ,Modern Languages department
 CIV10,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"I don't know how anyone can NOT like Aimaq. she is fantastic and makes every class into insightful discussions. She is very open to many ways of thinking and to students' opinions. Even if there is a youtube video you find interesting, she will let you play it. NOT a hard grader. I would take another class she taught in an instant.",Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department
 PHIL30,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,He posts very clear notes from each lecture on Sakai. He has 5 mini exams throughout the semester. Going to his office hours is EXTREMELY helpful. He's very understanding and worked with me to raise my grade after two bad test grades. I went to see him before I turned in my first paper and I got a higher than class average grade. Great guy.,Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department
 CS50,3.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"The course web site is well organized and has a ton of really helpful resources, which makes up for his occasional lack of clarity.",Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department
 ECON102,3.0,5.0,,,,Yes,awesome,Brock Blomberg ,Economics department
 FHS10,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,The class was very unorganized and her grading policy is unclear. Intense amounts of reading in an unreasonable amount of time. The class is specifically for first years but she was treating it like an upper-level class. Please do yourself a favor and don't take it unless you truly have an interest in the subject.,Nita Kumar ,History department
 CALC33,1.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"She takes the textbook and puts it on the board. Unforgiving, unhelpful and uninteresting.",Andrea Jedwab ,Mathematics department
 SPAN158,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Great teacher, you can tell she really loves what she does.  Helps out anyway she can, even proofread your paper before you turn it in, really wants you to do well. Already taken two classes with her and planning to take much more!",Lee Skinner ,Modern Languages department

 BIO43,3.0,4.0,,,,No,"While she is helpful if you go to see her outside of class, she routinely fails to get through her lecture outline within the class time. Her questions on exams are very unclear and many students miss points because they don't understand what she is asking.",Amy Chow ,Biology department

 ECON102,4.5,4.0,Yes,,B,Yes,"As a non econ major, this was tough class, but interesting. Reading the textbook helps, cause lectures go fast. But if you can stay on top of the material, it's awesome class. Shelton is willing to help if you feel  behind. Go to TA's review sessions, they will save your grade. They're both nice to look at during lecture too.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department
 ECON139,2.5,4.0,,,,No,"investments is a cool class and hughson's an awesome guy, but he's just not very good at explaining things. he comes to class prepared and he tries his best, but he's pretty confusing and really dry. workload and difficulty are average for an upper level econ/finance course. if you can prove to him that you know what you're doing, you'll be fine.",Eric Hughson ,Economics department
 BIOL143,3.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"I disagree with the earlier post. While Prof. Karpel is hard on his exams, if you studied properly and went to office hours, you will see he never tricks you on exams and only tests on stuff he covers. Maybe you should try to come to class more often and seek help when you are struggling?",Jonathan Karpel ,Biology department
 GOVT142E,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof. Pei's class was absolutely amazing. He definitely expected a lot of reading, but the readings were selected fantastically, and each one was interesting. In class, he started with a discussion and left lecturing to the end to build off of the discussion.",Minxin Pei ,Government department
 SPAN123,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Reading was manageable, with 1-page write-ups every few weeks.  You discuss the reading both as a large group and a small group of two and the profesora will come around to grade discussion.  However... she gets really upset if you're even 1-minute late AND requires that you raise your hand to ask permission to use the bathroom.",Raquel Vega-Duran ,Modern Languages department
 GENCHEM,3.5,4.0,,,B,Yes,"He is a very difficult teacher, no doubt.  However he is an amazingly helpful resource.  He truly cares about how you do; if you try hard in his class he notices and gives you the benefit.",Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department
 CHEM15,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,She is literally the KINDEST professor ever. I accidentally slept through my midterm today and was so distressed! I went to see her about it and she was nothing but understanding. She reassured me that things will be okay and accommodated my schedule so that I could best take the makeup w/o feeling stressed. She's super helpful. She's an angel!,Kayla Kaiser ,Chemistry department
 ECON134,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,No,Great great professor! Really approachable and the materials are informative and easy to follow.,Murat Binay ,Economics department
 PHIL33H,5.0,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,One of the best class I've taken at CMC. He is really smart and challenging and he extorts you with counter-argument and counter-counter-argument within a blink. He explains complex abstract ideas with very interesting examples. The readings and writings are really hard but he gives lots of instructions. Hard grader. But you will learn A LOT.,Andrew Schroeder ,Philosophy department
 GOV070,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Fabbe is crazy smart and is an expert in Middle Eastern Politics. She's helpful and pretty clear about the course material. We had pop quizzes every now and again, but mainly because we didn't do our reading and she got annoyed with it. Highly recommended.",Kristin Fabbe ,Government department
 LIT058,4.5,4.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Oddly enough he's one of the most charismatic lecturers around. You'll know what I mean when you witness him in action. Pretty much everyone is in love with him (and his dog, Bear). TAKE HIS CLASS! You'll learn lots and you'll be inspired to pursue literature. ",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department
 PHIL30,4.5,1.0,,,,No,"Super, super easy class. Very clear about his expectations and very helpful. Discussion based class which was really helpful. That said, the topic itself was really annoying because he didn't give us a chance to put our opinion in there. Just told us what was fact and what was not and that was it.",Eric Yang ,Philosophy department
 FWD,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,Nice professor. Helps if you go to office hours.,Evan Kindley ,Literature department
 MATH030,3.0,4.0,,,,No,"In 3 yrs he might be a decent teacher, but this semester he was painfully inexperienced, and the students who actually cared to put a lot of work into the course, paid the price. His tests were unpredictable, making it difficult to know what focus on for studying. His course is much harder than other MATH030s. Not too helpful in office hours either",David Krumm ,Mathematics department
 HIST90,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,C,Yes,"We had to play this ridiculous and grueling role-playing history game to pass this class, which pretty much sums it up. Just skip this professor. As stated, grading is very arbitrary. Do not take unless history major and are very very committed to the field. Strange college class, but CMC is very strange.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department
 ECON101,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Prof. T is extremely caring. Two mid-terms and one final - and one of them will be extremely tough. But she curves the class at the end, and even gives students the option of adding more weight to their final if they do well. She's very organized, but sticks only to the notes w/o real-life examples. I'd recommend - very straightforward.",Oana Tocoian ,Economics department

She is a wonderful professor who tries to ensure that her students do well with helpful office hours. She may rush at times with pwpt lectures, but her board lectures are clear. Overall, I highly recommend her.",Gretchen Stanton ,Chemistry department
 FWS1,1.5,4.0,Yes,,,No,Lots of work. Not helpful. Felt like a waste of time. She is well intentioned though.,Kathryn Stergiopoulos ,Literature department
 FWS,4.0,3.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"Giulio expects a lot from you, but he is a great professor. His FWS class was interesting yet demanding. He kind of hammered everyone on the first assignment, but don't get frustrated. Go talk to him during office hours - it will help your paper a lot!",Giulio Pertile ,Literature department
 GOV020,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Professor Rose is a great professor. Her lectures are very clear and conversation based. As with any GOV 020 class, there is a fair bit of reading, but she does her best to male sure we understand and analyze it. Great intro gov professor. ",Shanna Rose ,Government department
 MATH109,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,This is such a boring class. The worst Math class I have ever taken. This professor is new and does not know yet how to teach an interesting class.,Blake Hunter ,Mathematics department
 HIST100,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,This class is unlike any other at CMC. The war simulation is so elaborate that many non-majors were drawn in. Professor Hopper is super devoted to the simulation and went out of his way to make it the best experience. Class discussion often leads to thought-provoking moral debates. His grading is not as tough as students may think it is at first. ,Ian Hopper ,History department
 CHEM116,4.0,4.0,Yes,,A-,No,"Neeraja is so sweet and a great scientist. She is pretty rushed in her lectures. Her tests are exactly like her practice exams but 10x the intensity. You will see things that you didn't go over once in awhile, but they are reasoning questions not mechanisms you didn't cover. She is a great person to talk to about life. Definitely recommend her.",Neeraja Dashaputre ,Chemistry department
 BIO43,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Professor Cohen was by far the most helpful and caring teacher Ive experienced in my college career. He is available at all hours of the day to answer any questions you might have and you can tell he really wants you to succeed in his class. It was also one of the most challenging classes I have taken and expect to work hard if you want to do well,Joseph Cohen ,Biology department
 ECON125,3.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Very nice professor: funny and super chill. Not a fan of the teaching style (She writes notes on the board, you copy them down, rinse and repeat.)  Material can seem arcane, but exams were extremely easy. (Memorization rather than understanding is rewarded). Overall not the most invigorating class.",Angela Vossmeyer ,Economics department
 HIST100,1.5,3.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"Professor Lower seems like she would be a good researcher, but did not run her class very well. She was not clear of her expectations for assignments, assigned massive amounts of reading that was never discussed, and was not consistent or clear in grading assignments.",Wendy Lower ,History department
 FHS10,4.0,1.0,Yes,,A+,No,"This man was a little scatter-brained at times and the class was more lecture-based than most FHS classes, but we definitely read some interesting stuff and he is so knowledgeable. Take him if you're looking for an easy A--most lenient grader ever. He's also willing to help on papers. Definitely going to take another class with him!",Glen Cooper ,History department
 CHEM014,4.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,"Straightforward lectures, reasonable tests, and easy homework (which can be done with 100% as long as you do it and not give up). Lectures have REEF polls which will require you to stick around in the lecture room; otherwise, you will lose 10% for participation. Rinaldi is very reasonable and accessible, though her office is a bit hard to find.",Arlie Rinaldi ,Chemistry department
 CHEM116,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof. Hurlocker is hard (but she's been getting easier) but SO worth it. Yes, she follows the textbook, but personally dont think that's bad at all. Her energy is infectious and she's super accommodating, approachable, and caring about her students' out-of-class wellbeing. Fav science teacher by far!",Brisa Hurlocker ,Chemistry department
 GOV127,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Pears is really great! Super down to earth, really smart and nice.

I wish she taught more gov elective classes so I could take another class with her!",Emily Pears ,Government department
 RLST143PHIL170,2.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Terrible professor. Great person. I would invite him to my wedding, but I would not take his class again in my life. Discussions are not engaging in the slightest. Average 20 pages of reading a week with a reading response. If you can sit there, don't pay attention, then not feel bad, take this class. You'll be screwed for midterms and final.",Gregory Antill ,Philosophy department
 CSCI55,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,"I have mixed feelings about Professor Shaar. While he is nice and he did get better throughout the semester, it was clear to me that to him teaching did not come first. There we classes where he would spend the entire class period trying to solve one example. On tests, he will take off around 2% of your final grade for one trivial mistake.",Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department
 BIOL171,5.0,2.0,,Yes,A,No,Prof Nagel was so excited to teach Bio of Cancer and really brought this enthusiasm to the classroom. She is super sweet and funny and makes hard topics much more approachable. She's also very down to earth and a great lecturer!,Anastasia Nagel ,Biology department
 HIST166,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Chelsea is very good at facilitating discussion and all discussions are dependent on the readings. You can get by without reading however participation matters and she looks out for it, a lot. She grades your papers harshly, but if you make effort to improve she will recognize it.",Chelsea Wang ,History department
 BIO044,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Gilbert cares a lot about her students, and you can tell. But she seems pretty disorganized and wasn't very clear about what she expects from us (which makes the tests difficult). However, she seems to be trying to improve the class, so hopefully next year she will have a better idea of how to teach.",Princess Gilbert ,Biology department
 ECON125,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,Gillen is knowledgeable in his field but is ineffective in teaching the class. He fails to explain econometrics outside of complex mathematical terms. His grading is forgivable and he gives a ton of credit for showing up and doing the work. I would have much rather been in a class that makes me work harder so that I understand the material.,Benjamin Gillen ,Economics department
 MATH050,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,B+,Yes,"She doesn't really teach anything but the basics well. Your best chance for learning is talking with other kids in the class and looking up how to solve problems online. Luckily, the class was curved a good amount so if you put in a lot of work you can get a respectable grade.",Helen Wong ,Mathematics department
 PHIL034,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Great professor, super helpful outside of (and inside of) class, and very clear grader who assigns a manageable workload. If you are interested in her area of expertise (which is very relevant to a lot of present social issues), I would highly recommend taking her class.",Rima Basu ,Philosophy department
 152,4.5,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"This class was awesome.   I thought the subject would be incredibly boring, but this ended up being one of my favorite classes while at CMC.  I would recommend it to everybody.  ",James Taylor ,Accounting department
 GOV20,4.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"At first I was hesitant to take a class with Professor Thomas because of what past students have said about the difficulty of the class. But I am so glad I have taken it. This class challenged me in ways I have never been before, and I really grew as an analytical writer and an effective arguer. Definitely recommend this class. ",George Thomas ,Government department
 ECON101,4.0,2.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Professor Flory is a great choice for micro. He gives weekly homework sets that are graded on completion, so you don't have to worry about your grade until the tests come around. The tests are mostly a rehash of the homework, so if you go over the problem sets you'll do fine. Quirky sense of humor, would recommend.",Jeffrey Flory ,Economics department
 HIST100,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,Johny is a Greek God. He convinced me to take a history dual with my major. He is by far the most helpful prof at CMC if you visit his office hours (He's always available) and will help you with outside-class stuff too.   LOTS of reading though. 200 pages a week for my class. But totally worth it.,Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department
 ECON086,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,"Ganguly's class was by far the most time consuming course I have taken. You learn a lot but it is pretty much all on your own time. Friendly guy, but I would not take this class again if given a second chance.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department
 GOV020,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"A truly wonderful man. Does not assign any homework, your grade consists of a midterm, final paper, and final test. He will stand up and speak for the entire time but you only need to take notes when you directly ask what is on the test a few days before. Tests are not difficult. Enjoy the class",Ralph Rossum ,Government department
 ECON187,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I have taken more than one classes with him. Definitely my favorite professor ever.  He's clear, organized, helpful. Right amount of workload and all exam questions are very reasonable.",David Bjerk ,Economics department
 ECON86,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,C-,No,"Extremely difficult, unhelpful. Guy is a total robot and an awful teacher. Lectures are guided, fill in the blanks, however he tests on conceptual things that aren't covered in the lectures. Sucks", Andrew Finley ,Economics department
 CHEM014,1.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Hands down the worst prof I've had at CMC. Great teacher if you're a chem genius, if not you're out of luck. Is aggressively unhelpful and ridicules those who ask for clarification or extra help.",Anthony Fucaloro ,Chemistry department
 RLST171,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof Espinosa is great, but he LOVES to talk (about himself). Ask him 1 question and his response will be an hour long (I timed this). He also expects A LOT from his students. The amount of reading and writing u have to do is almost inhumane. That being said, he also cares a lot, and his classes r very interesting and fun if u r willing 2 work hard",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 PSYCH96,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,Good class. Prof. Reed's lectures can be boring but she is very enthusiastic about the material. Take it if you are genuinely interested in memorizing brain parts and their functions. Lots of group work and you read a lot of research. Prof. Reed is a bit moody at times.,Catherine Reed ,Psychology department
 ECON050,4.0,4.0,,Yes,B+,No,"Super engaging lectures & not that much homework (homework is a bit difficult but tutoring and office hours makes it very manageable). The exams are HARD, the lectures are mostly general concepts and the exams are mostly calculation and applications. Many people failed & got C's on the first midterm, but extra credit report will help overall grade",Serkan Ozbeklik ,Economics department
 ECON101H,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"If you get the chance to take Professor Lincoln, then jump on it. Teaches you all the basic concepts and makes learning them feel natural. Really helpful in office hours so it is always worth it to go. Likes to throw in a joke every now and again but the lectures are mainly content. With some light studying and reviewing-the tests are very passable",William Lincoln ,Economics department
 GOVT167,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Kesler is a wonderful, wonderful professor. This is the second semester I have taken a class with him and I want to take more. I sit there, listening to him lecture for nearly three hours but I am engaged the entire time. He is compelling and interesting and so intelligent. I encourage everyone to take a class with this professor. 11/10.",Charles Kesler ,Government department
 MATH31,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"I took Calculus IIA which is intended for freshman who took ap calc. This class was like half review half new content. Nelson lectures fast and the material can be tricky at times, but if you go to the QCL and do the homework you will be fine. The grading scale makes it easy to do well in the class.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 GOV105,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I took Org. Health Care/Public Policy with Prof Lynch which was one of my favorite courses by far at CMC.

Take this class and you won't regret it!",Frederick Lynch ,Government department
 FIN425,3.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"The class was fast paced, dense, and very quantitative; he breezes over mathematical calculations perhaps bc he was a physics major but I had a really hard time with the math. Prof Yu is super nice and honestly a god when it comes to partial credit. I'd recommend his electives only to quant folks, though corp fin should be fine for anyone.",Fan Yu ,Accounting department
 ECON050,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,C,Yes,"Marie Evans is a very intelligent Professor and most her classes are lecture based (bearing in mind the large number of students in the class), however she will occasionally use Moblab to make class more interesting. She is really good at teaching, but her tests are really difficult so you have to really prepare well for them.",Mary Evans ,Economics department
 HIST055,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,Professional. Thorough. Good into to MENA studies course. One of the most genuine professors I ever had.,Heather Ferguson ,History department
 EA30,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,Dr. Faldyn is a great knowledge professor and I really enjoyed the spring Science and The Environment course. The lectures are straight forward and study guides are provided before each test. Be prepared for quizzes but for my class we did many in class activities which counted as a quiz instead. Highly recommend any class with him!!,Matthew Faldyn ,Biology department

 FHS10,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,"Looking back at my college career, this class was probably the most unrewarding class I've ever taken. I would suggest to look at different FHS courses; Michon is unreasonable with his grading (doesn't make any sense) because he is a name grader. His midterm exam was difficult as well, and his assignments are redundant and a waste of time.",Daniel Michon ,Religion & Philosophy department
 BIO44,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"One of the best profs at Keck! His lectures are really fun- you can tell how much he loves the subjects he teaches, and is really knowledgeable.

Definitely want to take more upper level courses with him teaching.",Lars Schmitz ,Biology department
 GOVT70,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof. Koch is the best professor I've had so far. Her lectures flow smoothly between students and teacher, and she strives to consider everyone's background/perspective on the material.

 GOV20,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"I have never had a bad experience with a CMC professor, but Courser was definitely an exception.

You will not get above a B on paper unless you agree 100% with his opinion.",Zachary Courser ,Government department
 PHYS32,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Physics is hard. ...But Naftilan made it so much better than I imagined. He explains concepts clearly, has great stories, and is always there to help (plus, because it's such a tough class he's a pretty lenient grader so long as you're trying/turning in hw/improving). I could not recommend a physics prof more highly- TAKE HIS CLASS! :)",Steve Naftilan ,Physics department
 CSCI036,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"Prof. Huber is an awesome DS prof! He introduced me to CS, and I wouldn't have wanted any other prof.

He's always available for extra help, and he's hilarious too!",Mark Huber ,Mathematics department
 MS050,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Such a sweet man! Made film theory interesting and accessible in his Intro to Film summer class. Because it was summer, it was a small evening class and relatively quiet. I imagine in the regular semester his classes are more lively. Would recommend!",James Morrison ,Literature department
 GOV141,5.0,3.0,,,,No,Terril is one of the best teachers (refuses to be called a professor) I've had in my educational career. He's truly willing to go above and beyond for his students.

She expects a fair amount from her students, but in a refreshing way.",Christine Crockett ,Literature department
 ECON101,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B-,Yes,"Professor Olfati is great, you can tell she is a mom because she is very caring.

 PHYS033,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,B-,Yes,"Professor Wells goes on rambling lectures, never answers questions, makes things more confusing than they should be, and will jump at every opportunity to talk about his horses. 3/2 majors, don't take physics with him!

 FHS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I'm so happy I took FHS with Professor Selig! I never would've thought to take a Gender Studies class, but it ended up being very eye-opening and engaging material. There was quite a bit of reading but it's all very interesting and prevalent to everyday life. Our grade was comprised of participation and four, five-page essays about the readings.",Diana Selig ,History department
 LIT134,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,B+,No,"Took him for Spy Films, thought it would be a cool class. His selection of films was stale, the discussions were cringy, and he didn't encourage diverse opinions. PoC, save yourself the pain and don't take any of his classes.",Robert Von Hallberg ,Literature department
 PHYS34,3.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Took him because there weren't any other alternatives. Pleasantly surprised. Interesting guy, very VERY organised, lectures are most definitely rehearsed.

 ECON186,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Grant really cares about your success. She wants you to become a more thoughtful economics student and a better person.

One of the nicer people I've ever met. Seriously.",Laura Grant ,Economics department
 ECON102,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Professor Burdekin is my favorite Econ professor at CMC so far! His lectures were extremely clear and focused mostly on the intuition of theoretical concepts.

Go to office hours!",Richard Burdekin ,Economics department
 PPE001,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Hurley is one of the best professors at CMC. He's incredibly kind, thoughtful, and wants to help you understand the material.

He also happens to be pretty hilarious.",Paul Hurley ,Philosophy department
 PSYC030,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,Great teacher. Graded on 5 short essays which weren't too hard if you pay attention in class and a final project. She is funny and keeps class interesting.

 GOV144,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,Professor Sinha is fantastic. She knows what she is doing and is an extremely knowledgeable scholar and professor.

 HIST103,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B,Yes,If you like Roman and Late Antique History there is no Professor better than Prof Bjornlie.

Not an easy professor but he is fair and the work is always manageable.,shane Bjornlie ,History department
 FWS10,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Really good guy and a great person to just talk to. He's a really caring person too, and will reward you if you're showing growth in your writings.

He helps you bring out your creativity and immerses you in this seemingly mundane, yet intricate and vastly interesting topic",Kevin Moffett ,Literature department
 PHIL039,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"I really enjoyed Professor Rajzci's class. He cares about student input.

 GOV145,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B-,Yes,Took two of her classes in one semester and it was brutal. Probably some of the most work I have done in a Government class.

 CHEM14,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,"Contradicts himself in lecture, does not use book and has his own website with explanations. Exams are impossibly graded.

 LIT124,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,Professor Warner is a phenomenal professor. He is extremely kind and offers a lot of support.

His classes are fascinating: even if you don't like reading you will learn a lot. He replies to emails and gives feedback instantly.,Nicholas Warner ,Literature department
 FHS010,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,A-,Yes,Most painful class I've ever taken. Most end up with fine grades but the stress is not worth it. Gives horrible grades on early essays then better grades at the end to make you think you've become a better writer when you've probably gotten worse. Tells you your ideas are bad if they don't match hers. Her writing advice won't fly in any other class,Megan Gallagher ,Literature department
 LIT111,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,I think the class could have gone a little deeper and she could have connected a little better with us. Classroom environment felt a little fake and cold,Ellen Rentz ,Literature department
 PSYCH030,4.0,1.0,Yes,,A,Yes,Prof Stacey's intro to Psych class is clearly one of the best classes I have taken. Though she is a touch grader she expects her students to learn as much as possible.

 PSYC37,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Hilarious man! The material is fairly straightforward and clear, and he bases his tests mostly off of the notes from class, with a little bit from the book. 40 multiple choice, and 3 short answers.

Excellent professor!!",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 PHIL095,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Her class is difficult and she expects a lot from you, but it's worth it. She doesn't collect homework, but do it if you want to pass.

 MATH032,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,C,Yes,I like that she is available to students and tries to be understanding and accommodating! But the class was not engaging and I didn't end up learning very much because the class didn't make me want to work for it. She has an agenda that she doesn't want to stray from so we often went ahead in the syllabus despite feeling lost.,Chiu-Yen Kao ,Mathematics department
 PHIL101,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Kreines is the best professor I have ever had. He made me fall in love with Philosophy. I am in my second class with him and can't recommend him enough. There are two papers and two exams per semester and his goal is to help you write the best papers you can and learn as much as you can. Not easy but 100% worth it.,James Kreines ,Philosophy department
 CHEM117,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,He's great! Very helpful in office hours,Joel Mackey ,Chemistry department
 FHS010,1.0,2.0,,No,A-,No,"Professor Uvin is one of the worst professors I have ever had. His feedback is rude, unhelpful, and downright degrading. He belittles his students and makes you second guess your abilities. He assigns way too much reading and classes are boring, not engaging, and hard to follow. He grades papers easily, but grades group projects extremely hard.",Peter Uvin ,Government department
 BIO43,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Awesome Professor, really cares about her students and her office hours are a must. She's super helpful with answering questions and as long as you are engaged in her class and actively participating you'll be fine. Office hours are super helpful especially with the problem sets assigned. Tests are fair, you need to know the material to do good.",Findley Finseth ,Biology department
 BIO43,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,A,No,"Kind enough guy who tries and cares but did not feel that he explained class concepts or in-class activities clearly, which was frustrating. Struck me as being more of a researcher than a teacher. Exams were mostly fair with one or two questions that did not appear anywhere in the reading or in lecture. Did not feel inspired taking this class.",Pete Chandrangsu ,Biology department
 ECON50,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof. Fernholz is a fantastic professor. Econ50 is a class with 40+ people yet it never feels that big -- he will always take the time to get to know you and help you. Econ50 can be hard yet he explains everything extremely well, though you will need to work. For a compulsory class like 50 -- there isn't a professor better than him.",Ricardo Fernholz ,Economics department
 HIST116,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof Livesay is a caring and an effective teacher. I've popped by his office many times to just chat about history and etc. and he was always happy to oblige. I found the readings he assigned to be very interesting, as well as the assignments (a creative writing final paper). Great guy who's cares about his students and wants to see you succeed.",Daniel Livesay ,History department
 PSYCH175,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Even though the class was online, Professor Feitosa made lectures engaging and also gave us an opportunity to get to know one another through fun activities. She does expect you to put in the work to earn the grade but is also readily available to help out in any way she can. Definitely recommend taking a class with her!",Jennifer Feitosa ,Psychology department
 PHIL038,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Locke's class had, by far, the most interesting readings of any course I have taken so far. If the idea of learning more about time travel or the free will debate interests you, take this course. He can be picky with writing assignments, but his goal is to make you a better analytical writer, not just let you coast through the class.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department
 SPAN044,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"This class helped strengthen my grammar skills, and I'm glad that we also learned more about Spain + Latin American culture. At times, she went a little quickly over the material, but she was accessible after class and during office hours if you had questions. She thoughtfully listened to each student during discussions, and was understanding.",Nicole Altamirano ,Modern Languages department
 GOV020H,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Pitney's online class was the highlight of my week. He is funny but highly educative. He has a vast knowledge of Gov and would recommend anyone to take any of his classes. The only thing you gotta know is you have to write like Strunk & White, he is very upfront about that.",John J. Pitney ,Government department
 MATH030,3.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Aksoy is one of the sweetest professors at the college. I took her intro calc after having already taken Calc I and II in high school, so naturally it was very easy for me. That being said, her lectures were sometimes confusing and I wouldn't have followed if I hadn't already taken the class. If you've had calc, her class is really easy!",Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department
 GOVT117,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof Miller is a pretty dry lecturer, but I still learned so much in this class. It's really a masterclass on everything CA Politics and is a must-take for anyone interested in getting into that space. The trip to Sacramento is one of the best things I've done in Claremont!",Ken Miller ,Government department
 SPAN33,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,Best Professor I have had at college. He really cares about you and the class environment. I am very close with everyone in that class now. At first he seems really tough but he's a sweetheart and will help you. Small homeworks and only a couple tests.,Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department
 LIT130,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Class was graded on completion so if you did all the weekly assignments/showed up to every class you get an A. Assigned a wide range of movies and I genuinely learned so much about film! He has an interesting/quiet demeanor but he's funny and loves hearing what his students have to say. HIGHLY recommend if you like talking about movies.,Thomas Schur ,Literature department
 ECON102,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"One of the best experiences I have had with a teacher, extremely caring very good at explaining concepts and very accessible. I took Macro with him and although the material was a bit dry I enjoyed every class.",Yong Kim ,Economics department

 GOV20,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Favorite Professor yet at Claremont Mckenna College. Most classes were heavily discussion-based. He is available during office hours and will make more office hours if you cannot meet on his specific date. Truly enjoyed every class. I recommend taking a class with him!!,Michael Fortner ,Government department
 GOV020,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,A-,Yes,"Bright and knowledgeable but lecture intensive, dry, boring, and too monotonous. Appears he follows the same script every year. No class intimacy or fun times. Class engagement is dry too, and he makes little effort to break ice. Too many readings - easier to finesse with summaries, that's how I made it.",Mark Blitz ,Government department
 FWS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"took Blackness in American Cinema with Prof Smith and I LOVED it! For anyone interested in film, or or wants to think and talk about movies in a new way, take this class. Lots of films to watch, but not much writing. He doesn't rly teach writing even though it's an FWS, so if you struggle there you might want to go to a more hands-on prof.",Derik Smith ,Literature department
 MATH171,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"This man turned me into a math major in his linear algebra. Then I took his abstract algebra. Amazing class. Also the exams are thematic and extremely fun to take. If you are a math major or love math you will definitely find his class very very interesting. If not, don't feel bad to drop. A lot of people dropped his linear algebra in my year.",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department
 PHYS33L,1.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Higdon is a bro. He is a great and goofy guy to get to know. But besides that, he is not a great professor: scattered and boring lectures with convoluted explanations. I understood physics before taking this class. You can survive, though, from reading the textbook, teaching yourself from external resources, and doing the homework diligently.",James Higdon ,Physics department
 PSYCH70,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Prof Krauss approaches the subject of abnormal psychology in an excellent way. He brings lightness and humor to a subject that can be difficult, but not in a way that is disrespectful or harmful to individuals. He teaches the class extraordinarily well and provides examples from personal experiences with clients. He always had funny lectures, too!",Daniel Krauss ,Psychology department
 ECON150,2.0,3.0,Yes,,,No,He's alright. Lectures were very boring and oftentimes not very clear. You have to do a lot of studying on your own.,Matthew Magilke ,Accounting department
 HIST129,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"Professor Lisa Cody cares. She cares about the subject matter of her courses, she cares about her students, she cares about her teaching. Her understanding of life circumstances that we all know may come across as ridiculous sometimes is incomparable. She wants you to succeed, and will make the effort if you do. Read, show up, think, and write well",Lisa Cody ,History department
 GOV20,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof Muravchik is one of the best teachers I've ever had. As someone with zero background in American politics, she was so understanding, and willing to lend her time to answer all questions. If you genuinely try, she will do everything she can to get you to an A. Would recommend her 10000%. So intelligent and amazing.",Stephanie Muravchik ,Government department
 GOV020,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Busch is a solid option for Gov020. Short, bi-weekly essays about the material + a comprehensive final (no midterm!). My biggest piece of advice is to stay engaged during class (ie. put your laptop away!!). I truly believe the main reason I received an A was because I showed that I cared about his lectures and participated whenever possible.",Andrew Busch ,Government department
 CALC2,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,his class was hard but not as hard as my c*ck while watching him solve math problems. i love this guy and the heart attacks he goes through to teach us,Michael O'Neill ,Mathematics department
 CHEM116,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,Absolutely amazing.  She has the biggest heart and is always putting the students first.  Ochem is a tough class but she is there by your side every step of the way.  Really upset I didn't get into her class for second semester. ,Anna Wenzel ,Chemistry department
 KOREANCULTURE,3.5,2.0,,,,,"Great class, lot of movies.  The final and midterm are a breeze if you use the study guide.  There's some work involved, but not a huge time commitment.  Class is a lot of fun and fairly easy A.",Minju Kim ,Modern Languages department
 ECON086,3.5,4.0,Yes,,B-,No,"Prof Massoud is the bomb! He's the nicest person you can ever meet! But beware of his classes, they're tough!! You need to work at least 12-15 hours every single week without a midterm or the final. Past papers help, but he's still tough! His accent may be difficult to understand, and he talks fast, but is extremely patient! ",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department
 RLST151,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,No,"I have no idea how she got such positive reviews. I took this course hoping for an interesting break from Econ and her material was not cohesive, readings were boring, the ideas were all over the place and she graded papers very harshly. There are 2 million tiny assignments that are difficult to keep track of and the class was not interesting.",Esther Chung-Kim ,Religious Studies department
 RLST128,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Velji is knowledgable about his discipline. His class is for the most part engaging, but sometimes he explains topics in overly verbose terms that are not accessible to students. He is a tough grader, and his grading criteria is not very clear. He could do a better job of engaging everyone in class (some students did not speak at all).",Jamel Velji ,Religious Studies department
 PSYC037,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,Yes,"I am a psychology major and he literally made me rethink my choice! He is definitely very knowledgeable in his field however the way he communicates it to young students is very mundane, bland and uninspiring. A very nice person but grades pretty harshly which is unfair because he is not very clear on what he wants.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department
 FHS010,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I loved nadons class, i really learned a lot. Hes really hard to please but as long as you read and participate in class youll be fine",Christopher Nadon ,Government department

 FREN033,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Shelton is the sweetest. She never wants to overwork students, so there are only a few short quizzes and tests. Sometimes she breezes over things quickly, but she teaches based on the textbook, so it is easy to reference the lesson. Homework consist of textbook exercises. They're relatively easy if you actually read the lesson beforehand.",Marie-Denise Shelton ,Modern Languages department
 GOV60,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,Camp is amazing. He was my advisor and I took most of my gov classes from him. He's very calm and extremely wise. He helped me get my first job out of college and it's been all downhill since then--constant world traveling for my dream job. I owe so much to this man!,Roderic Camp ,Government department
 ECON165,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Good lecturer, very organized and knowledgeable about his subjects. I recommend him.",Darren Filson ,Economics department
 FREN22,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Best french teacher ever! She's really enthusiastic and animated about the subject matter and will randomly start singing in French during class which is really cute. She loooves when students stop by for office hours, and the classwork is moderate. Study hard and you'll do well.",Sylvie Young ,Modern Languages department
 CORE1,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Sanii is an amazing Core professor. He is open to student suggestions and is willing to try new things. As a chemistry professor he provided an interesting perspective on the literature-heavy Core 1 curriculum. He allowed the students to lead and guide class discussions. Overall, the class was a positive experience.",Babak Sanii ,Chemistry department

 PHIL161,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Hard class, but I loved this class, real interesting. Prof Humes really cares about her students, even cooked great Indian food for us!! Only probem is she doesn't teach that often, and only teaches the same class when she does.",Cynthia Humes ,Religious Studies department
 ECON101,4.0,2.0,Yes,,A-,No,"Everyone gives Professor Wright a bad rap on campus. When I signed up for his course so many people warned me against it; however, I enjoyed his course. If you pay attention in class and take his notes, you have all the information that he will test you on. Plus, he is more than willing to help anyone out during office hours.",Colin Wright ,Economics department
 LITSECT,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"I'm not a lit major but I've taken several lit courses bc of Meyer.  Despite what other negative comments there might be, give her a chance.

She's brilliant and awesome!",Ann Meyer ,Literature department
 GOV020,4.0,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Awesome guy.  Old, tenured, but still clearly has a passion for education and learning.  Not in that he loves helping students but that he loves talking about his subject matter.  Lectures are boring and just a review of the reading, but he drops in nuggets about his life (was a spy).  CLASS IS GRADED ON A CURVE so 30% get As, 50% Bs, 20% Cs.",Jay Martin ,Government department
 ASTR66,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"His lectures and his tests are accurate, I have no idea what the last reviewer was talking about. If you are an intelligent  person the tests are not that difficult at all- I got an A without trying to hard. In spite of the fact that his lectures are all powerpoint presentations, this is probably one of the most interesting classes I've ever taken.",Thomas Dershem ,Physics department
 PHIL30,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,lectures are so clear & comprehensive that you don't need to read; just GO TO CLASS & take good notes. not an easy grader. knows a TON. open to student opinions but not much discussion - more focus on history of phil than student discussion. good class.,Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department
 PSYCH109,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Extremely clear powerpoint lectures. Makes chapters/ understanding material much easier. Book that is used is terrible, extremely confusing, but her lectures make up for it.  Tests are super hard, but it's mostly due to the content being difficult.  She is very approachable so help office hours are always there. Need to be self-motivated to do well",Shana Levin ,Psychology department
 CALC31,1.5,5.0,,,,No,"Ok. He is a sweet, crazy, little italian man. He does care about his students, and will try to help you. The problem is that he makes absolutely no sense when he talks. His lectures are impossible to follow, and he often starts talking to himself in Italian. He is entertaining sure, but the novelty wears off quickly. Avoid if at all possible.",Mario Martelli ,Mathematics department
 PHIL30,1.5,2.0,,,,No,"book needed for midterm/final but mainly based off her confusing lectures.very repetitive, easily sidetracked,always late for class. her projects are easy and class is easy to get an A in but if you are interested in psych or a psych major dont take,she wont prepare you for anything",Marjorie Charlop-Christy ,Psychology department
 HIST176,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Lofgren is a very sweet man who really cares about his students. However, a lot of people don't like his teaching style, which is pure lecture (no powerpoint, but he provides a brief outline). He cares enough about his students to email you after class to follow up on a question you asked. Very knowledgeable.",Charles Lofgren ,Political Science department
 CHEM116117,5.0,4.0,,,,,"Suck it up, it's o-chem and it's not easy.  He provides excellent explanations that make you understand WHY so that you can apply things broadly.  He expects broad understanding, so you'd better have it.  Also, replaces lowest test score with grade on final exam.  this is huge, everyone bombs at least one test.",Kersey Black ,Chemistry department
 ECON175,4.5,3.0,,,,No,Professor Antecol is in her element in this class. This is what she likes to research and it shows. Light work load day to day. Tests are very tricky but graded on a pretty soft curve.,Heather Antecol ,Economics department
 GOV70,4.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"My favorite class. Haley demands a lot, but he is worth it because you will really learn how to present and defend an argument under the kind of scrutiny you would receive out in the real world, where answers must be clear, precise, and short. Highly recommend. I got an A in his class and I consider it my biggest college achievement.",Edward Haley ,Government department
 MATH030,3.5,1.0,Yes,,A,No,Knowledgeable professor who wrote the textbook we use. Every class was lecture with no participation required. Sometime he blocks the board but he always hands out notes before class with everything you need to learn. Gives out practice tests one week prior to exams that are almost identical to the actual tests. HW was optional,Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 ECON102,2.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"This is the class that made me decide not to be an Econ major.  He simply could care less about the class and it shows. The answer keys on problem sets are disgraceful, since he doesn't give any explanations, and often even the answer is illegible. Exams really varied in toughness.  I got a B+ in this class and it was still the bane of my existence",Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department

 LIT68,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Prof Bilger is funny, nice and interesting. Lots of reading, but what do you expect in a lit class? Really uses class discussions well; our class on theater did performances too, which were fun. She knows her field well, and she gives you lots of freedom and feedback on papers. Definitely worthwhile, especially if you like seminar classes.",Audrey Bilger ,Literature department

 PHIL90,5.0,1.0,,,,,"What a great class.  You don't waste time on long-winded works: you study good summaries/examples of what each topic.  You get a huge breadth of information, which is great for an intro class.  Most importantly, you get to discuss ideas for most of the class, which is the whole idea behind philosophy.  It's a great class, and he's an easy grader.",Jefferson Huang ,Philosophy department

 BIOL132L,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Grades labs very hard (I don't think anyone ever got an A on a lab report). Lab will definitely bring down your grade, but on plus side, you get to play with toads.

Yelled at me for being late to lab once.",Marion Preest ,Biology department

 GOVT125,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Spalding is the only thing wrong with the D.C. program.  Her grading is subjective and arbitrary, her favorites are obvious, and, though she may seem nice in a group setting, she's a witch when she has a problem with you.  As a director, she doesn't hold to her own program rules, punishing students on a whim...and I'm a conservative male.",Elizabeth Spalding ,Government department
 BIOL177,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Wonderful professor.  Really cares about her students and willing to help outside of class.  You get use to her accent and her lecture slides make her lectures easy to follow.  Knows her stuff and is very passionate about the material!,Irene Tang ,Biology department

Would definitely take her again.",Lisa Meulbroek ,Economics department
 GOV20,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Extremely interesting anecdotes of his actual work in the US government for Reagan.  Uhlmann gives tests he says are ""without surprises"" but are quite difficult.

As a professor he made me really mad all the time.,Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department

 BIO62,1.0,3.0,,,,No,His grammar does not make any sense and often he gives horrible data which makes no sense to do the assigned labs from. He also does not value the opinions of women. He generally does not care about this class or making it enjoyable or useful for any of the students.,Dan Guthrie ,Biology department

 PSYCH30,1.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"One of the easiest classes i've ever taken at CMC. However, the guy was amazingly inadequate as a professor.

He does not teach clearly, if you go to his office hours he is completely unhelpful and just makes you feel bad for not knowing the material.

 MATH109,2.0,4.0,,,,No,"brand new course at cmc and it's so-so at best. german is a nice guy but explains complicated material as if students are already experts. midterms were very straightforward, but final exam came out of nowhere. students considered giving up on the final altogether part-way through the allotted time because it was that unreasonable.",David German ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"She used power points everyday but they were useful for the class (clean, legible graphs).  She also used the board to explain questions that came up fairly clearly.  She wants it to be fun for her students and gives plenty of hints and advice as to what to study for the exams.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department
 BIOL071,1.5,4.0,,,,No,She can be very helpful if you ask her direct questions but the lectures are very scattered and taking notes is frustrating.,Amy Chow ,Biology department
 HIST161,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Park is such a cool guy and really cares about his students learning. The class is basically just lectures and discussion. A 5 pg paper with 3 topics to choose from, an 8-10 pg research paper, and an optional final 5 pg paper. Kinda heavy on the reading but you can skim it and be fine. A 250 word post on sakai each week too. No attendance",Albert Park ,History department
 ECON102,3.5,5.0,Yes,,D,Yes,He is a very nice professor and always ready to help but there is a lot of hw and he is a tough grader!,Cameron Shelton ,Economics department
 BIOL143,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Exam questions are vague, unclear; tests you on things he never went over. Is trying to trick you on exams which makes your grade worse than it should be. Couldn't answer questions in class. Lectures are messy; notes from them will be useless. I could have done a lot better w/ a different prof. Only in his first years, but still needs to improve.",Jonathan Karpel ,Biology department
 GOV142E,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes, By far one of the best professors at the entire Claremont colleges! I also took his Gov 60 course and loved it but this was by far my favorite class at CMC!  Professor Pei turns you into a great thinker so that you can carefully argue and understand all viewpoints on any issue. I grew more as a learner in his class than any other college class!!!,Minxin Pei ,Government department
 SPAN44,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Great Prof. Easy to understand. Knows her stuff and conveys it well. Actually teaches you the language. she expects a lot from you in terms of preparation for each class including vocab, exercises, and 1-page writeups but it's manageable. tests are incredibly fair. Im not a spanish major but she made the class interesting and I learned a lot.",Raquel Vega-Duran ,Modern Languages department
 CHEM014L,4.0,5.0,,,A,Yes,"If you are a student that likes to challenge yourself and you are seeking to master  intro-chemistry, Kojima is a great choice.  He is challenging, but teaches very well and wants to push his students to do their best.  If you put the time and effort into his class, it pays off well.",Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department
 CHEM14,2.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Says she wants people to like chem or at least feel confident in it- did not achieve either with me. Went to her office hours a lot but she was scattered and very unhelpful. Poor job of explaining difficult concepts and often forgot to teach things in class that were then on homework, used in lab or on tests. Good intentions but failed execution.",Kayla Kaiser ,Chemistry department
 ECON134,5.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Take him in a heartbeat: best class at CMC. His lectures are so clear and interesting that you'll intuitively remember everything you learn from dqy 1, and time literally flies during class. Very friendly and has tons of office hours (like 8), and he wants you to succeed. Light HW, easy tests, fun project, and you'll definitely learn a lot.",Murat Binay ,Economics department
 PHIL033,5.0,3.0,,,Rather_Not_Say,Yes,"Basically brilliant. Never biased, super helpful/nice, engaging and clear. Take him and be enlightened by how old, dry texts can turn out interesting/relevant. Tough but fair grading - if you engage with the ideas you will learn so much, although you fly through the readings. Conclusion: invaluable class (even if you don't like phil), awesome prof.",Andrew Schroeder ,Philosophy department
 FWS,3.5,4.0,Yes,,,No,"Leland comes off as a pretentious prep boy, but once you get past that, he's one of the smartest, most intelligent people you'll ever meet. Give him time to grow on you because he will. Papers are tough because he doesn't give you a straight topic, but he will definitely help you through them. ",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department
 PHIL30,4.0,2.0,,,A+,Yes,"He is a great teacher, and one of the best for an intro class. Tests are super easy as he gives questions to you beforehand. Super helpful in office hours, and always willing to help. Must take his class",Eric Yang ,Philosophy department
 FSW,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,Helpful professor. ,Evan Kindley ,Literature department
 MATH030,3.5,1.0,,,,Yes,Don't blame the professor. The only problem in the class is many students do not realize that they are now in a college. They assume that all material in class is enough for exams. You need to do work by yourself. Professor Krumm prepares well for his classes and gives clear explanations.,David Krumm ,Mathematics department
 HIST090,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,B+,No,"I took this class as a GE hoping it would be easy. It wasn't nearly as easy as I hoped it would be, so if that's your reason for taking the class then there are probably better options. Other than that she's pretty cool and is willing to meet outside of class to help with essays. You have to read a lot but I think that's standard for history.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department
 ECON101,4.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Be warned; tests often have types of problems you have never seen before in homework or even the textbook. She's caring and will help you, though. Homework is easy enough, and note-taking is easy because she gives you blank versions of her lecture slides to fill in.",Oana Tocoian ,Economics department
 CHEM014L,3.5,4.0,Yes,,B-,No,"Probably one of the best out of all the chemistry professors at the intro level. His lectures are helpful and easy to understand most of the time, but if you're not getting it then just ask and he'll explain it again. Very helpful in office hours and really cares about all of his students. He will go over your test with you. His tests are difficult",Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department
 MATH55,2.0,3.0,Yes,,B,No,"She is not very clear at all.  I wish her lectures were more organized.  She fumbles with ideas a lot, and she gets confused by questions easily.  She was not terrible, but I would not take her again.",Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department
 CSCI062,4.0,2.0,,,A,No,"Although at first he built up a lot of excitement about the course, his lectures became very dry and useless to go to. He gave a pop ""quiz"" every now and then for attendance purposes, but you could get away with not going a few times. He is an incredibly nice and knowledgeable guy when you meet with him, but it is hard to stay alert in lectures.",John Sun ,Computer Science department
 LIT091,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,I adore Prof Stergiopoulos. She is one of the most passionate and insightful professors I have ever had. The poets that she selected were consistently interesting and her thoughtful feedback on essays definitely improved my writing. The workload was appropriately challenging yet reasonable. I always looked forward to this class. Highly recommended!,Kathryn Stergiopoulos ,Literature department
 FHS10,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Giulio (as we call him (not to his face) because we don't know how to pronounce his last name) is REALLY smart, but not such a charismatic lecturer. He loves to talk in office hours, and the assigned readings are super interesting. His personality is kinda funny and odd, but he's a good professor. No textbook but LOTS of novels",Giulio Pertile ,Literature department
 GOV020,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"She is an amazing professor. She keeps the course current and relevant. Participation definitely matters and she will challenge you to contribute, to think and to improve your writing skills. She gives excellent feedback on your research papers and the reading responses are definitely better than a midterm.",Shanna Rose ,Government department
 MAT60,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,There is a lot of homework but his tests are fair exams.  I would highly recommend his linear algebra class!   ,Blake Hunter ,Mathematics department
 HIST151E,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Professor Hopper's teaching is rewarding and innovative. He puts aside a lot of time to talk with students, and those sessions are truly inspirational. There is less reading than the average History class at CMC. The fluid grading system can be unsettling, but most students do better than they expect. I would definitely recommend his classes.",Ian Hopper ,History department
 CHEM116L,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A+,No,I absolutely loved Neeraja!  She was very helpful and extremely available for extra help and would clarify something for you as many times as it would take you to understand it (very helpful for ochem).  You can tell that she genuinely cared about everyone of her students as students and as people.  Her exams were difficult but doable.,Neeraja Dashaputre ,Chemistry department
 BIO171,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Professor Cohen is far and away the best professor I have ever had. He was also likely the most difficult professor I have ever had.  I learned more in this class than I have in any of my other classes in my 3 and a half college years, and left the classroom after the final knowing that I would always have a mentor and friend in professor Cohen.",Joseph Cohen ,Biology department
 ECON125,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Very charming (!) professor and extremely friendly during office hours. Lectures are organized and her jokes are great. As long as you take good class notes, tests and HW should be straightforward. Definitely take metrics with her if you can.",Angela Vossmeyer ,Economics department

 CHEM014,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Great professor! Expects a lot of her students but you should be fine if you engage in the lectures and take good notes. Helpful during office hours and very accommodating of students with illnesses. Taking her class again next semester :),Arlie Rinaldi ,Chemistry department
 CHEM116,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Her lectures restated what was in the book, which I found helpful. She is very organized & one of the only OChem profs who stuck to the syllabus. Her tests are tricky and hard, the averages were normally in the 65-75s. It was very hard to do well bc she expects you to know everything. She is a good lab prof but has VERY specific lab quizzes.",Brisa Hurlocker ,Chemistry department
 GOV20,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Professor Pears is a fantastic instructor. She makes her GOV20 class interesting by having it by discussion based, that way we really get to know what government is like rather than just learning a few definitions. She's super sweet and intelligent. The work is very manageable, as there's only 5 things in the gradebook. Overall, 100% recommend.",Emily Pears ,Government department
 PHIL30,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Great professor! Would totally recommend for philosophy GE, especially for science majors/other non-majors. He doesn't give a crazy workload as-is, and he readily grants extensions without penalty. He is really easy to reach outside of class for help, but you probably won't find yourself needing it.",Gregory Antill ,Philosophy department
 CSCI55,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Shaar is super nice and really want to help you out. He is not the best at explaining topics in class but if you go to office hours everything is explained very well. The midterms are straight forward, they are not to difficult and you know exactly what material will be tested.",Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department
 HIST163CM01,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I would highly recommend taking a class with Chelsea Wang! She is very accessible outside of class, extremely knowledgeable, cares about her students doing well, and values what everyone has to say. But note that her main focus in teaching history is on politics, treaties, and quotidian lifestyle and not on artistic/ cultural movements.",Chelsea Wang ,History department
 BIO44,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,her lectures are super confusing and expects students to retain a ridiculous amount of information for exams,Princess Gilbert ,Biology department
 CALC032H,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof Wong is a real gem, a kind-hearted professor who truly cares about her students and wants them to succeed. She makes you work to understand the material and grow an appreciation for it. She was so accessible outside of class/office hours and took extra steps to help me understand concepts and adjust to hard academics.",Helen Wong ,Mathematics department
 PHIL138,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Professor Basu is one of my favorite professors at CMC! She has a great, casual discussion-oriented structure to her classes and gives out pre-made handouts for you to follow along with in every class. She will always try and relate material to pop-culture and make references that everyone can easily engage with. You won't regret taking her class!",Rima Basu ,Philosophy department
 ECON191,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Doesn't put up with BS or lazy students and teaches like a real law class. Explains the material very well. Tests were pretty hard but doable if you studied well, except for the final, part of which came from the textbook manufacturer and asked ridiculous questions on stuff from chapters he didn't even tell us to read. Great prof overall though",James Taylor ,Accounting department
 90,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,amazing prof and class,George Thomas ,Government department
 ECON101,1.5,4.0,,,,No,"Did not let us out on time early, not helpful, only teaches in one way, hard to contact. One of the worst classes",Jeffrey Flory ,Economics department
 HIST78,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Relatively interesting class, 3 papers worth 10% each and a final. While this may sound easy, he is a stickler for the rules. Perfect grammar is necessary to even get a B+ in the class and he is quite stingy when it comes to handing out A's. Do not take this class if you're looking for an easy History GE",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department
 ECON086,5.0,5.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,No,"Youll struggle if youve never taken accounting! You HAVE TO review EVERYTHING or fall behind! Ganguly is an amazing prof though, willing to help, cares for his students, very passionate about acctg which is nice. his class covers more than massoud's. super doable to get an A but u have to dedicate time. participation matters, prepare to learn!",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department
 GOVT153,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,A-,Yes,He's definitely very right wing in his politics. Needs to be more impartial fair and balanced. I felt it was manipulative.,Ralph Rossum ,Government department
 ECON101,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Bjerk is incredible. He's very down to earth, easy to talk with, and a fair grader - the kind of professor who made me WANT to work really hard. The discussions we had as a class were intriguing and made the concepts and theory seem very relevant. Homework is quite manageable. I would highly recommend going to the weekly homework help sessions.",David Bjerk ,Economics department
 ECON86,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Finley has changed his curriculum to make his class a lot better. He provides notes for the class to print out that make everything really clear and easy to review. A bit dry, but he gets the job done and has a subtle sense of awkward humor.", Andrew Finley ,Economics department
 CHEM14,3.5,2.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"If you pay attention in class and ask questions when you're unclear, you'll do fine. He tests directly from his notes.",Anthony Fucaloro ,Chemistry department
 RLST171,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,No,"Prof Espinosa has high expectations from his students. Do not recommend taking him for a GE because it's a crapton of work. Class was 6-10 pm on Thursdays sometimes running over because he cannot keep time properly. He is disorganized and does not give back papers in a timely manner. That being said, his class is one of the more interesting ones.",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 PSY96,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,"Although lectures can be dry, Professor Reed clearly cares about her students, and takes time out of her own day to make sure everyone gets feedbacks on the tests. Her exams are demanding but as long as you put in the time to study you'll be fine. There's also a large final paper but she outlines it well and it's easier to complete than it looks.",Catherine Reed ,Psychology department
 ECON050,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Let me start by saying that econ and I don't get along. But if I had to suffer through econ for a GE requirement, I'm glad to have done it with Mr. Ozbeklik. He is such a sweetheart and will work you through any problem. He gives out the answers for quizzes and assignments AND he's not bad to look at... at all. Great teacher, terrible subject.",Serkan Ozbeklik ,Economics department
 ECON101,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Great professor with crystal-clear lectures (he posts slides online). Tests are easy if you review the material. Not a lot of work and doesn't require you to read the textbook. Answers questions directly and helpful in office hours, however lectures can move pretty fast and be very dry (he just reads off the slides).",William Lincoln ,Economics department
 GOV20,2.5,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Kesler is a government department dinosaur engrained in the prevailing traditional school of thought on American political science. Kesler is a wealth of knowledge, but his lectures often take 15-30 minute tangents and don't engage the material in critical, meaningful ways. Easy grading and loose expectations make Kesler a good easy GOV20 option",Charles Kesler ,Government department
 MATH032,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Nelson talks super quietly and rushes through the lectures. But don't fret, this is an easy A. You can earn a plethora of extra credit points on the homework and tests, such that you can literally fail the final and still get an A.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 GOV20,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Lynch was one of the best professors I have had at CMC in the GOV department. Very thoughtful and prompt feedback on papers and very accessible outside of class during office hours. Great class debates, discussions and reasonable work loads. Put in the work and you'll do great!",Frederick Lynch ,Government department
 ECON134,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Took Corp Fin with him. The class is made up of case studies and exams. There is little guidance on the case studies as he wants you to sort off figure it yourself and then go over it. I found that while annoying, it was a good way to learn. Tests are challenging but if you do the practice problems you will be fine.",Fan Yu ,Accounting department
 ECON050,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Professor Evans is definitely the #1 Econ 50 prof at the college for econ majors. She is detailed and rigorous, but manageable enough to work for it and pull a good grade. She is super kind and accessible in office hours, and works to make sure her students succeed. I really enjoyed my time with her.",Mary Evans ,Economics department
 HIST156,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I cannot say enough good things about Prof Ferguson she is so knowledgable, kind, and poised.

She is great at recommending sources and giving feedback. Overall a wonderful person. Take her class!!!",Heather Ferguson ,History department
 BIOL175,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Dr Faldyn is one of the best Keck professors. He is extremely knowledgable, passionate, and accessible outside of class.

 PHIL036,4.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Professor Toole (Dr. B) had an engaging, energizing, and fun class. There were readings due every class although many people got away without reading them.

 AISS1,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,Really helpful during office hours,Scot Gould ,Physics department
 BIO143,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Love this guy! Hands down my favorite professor here.

 GOV80,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Awesome Professor with reasonable reading requirements and inspiring lectures. He is sometimes disorganized but is a very lenient and understanding grader.

 FHS010,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,No,"His religion and modernity class is very interesting. He is very knowledgeable and dedicated.

Overall, I recomend.",Daniel Michon ,Religion & Philosophy department
 BIOL167,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"TAKE SENSORY EVOLUTION WITH THIS MAN. Best class I have ever taken. The class is basically an expansion of what he does his research on, so he's super into teaching it and offers a wealth of knowledge. No midterms - only take-home quizzes and a final paper for this class (not for all his others unfortunately) but great prof for ANY class!!!",Lars Schmitz ,Biology department
 GOV149,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Koch is incredibly intelligent. She's great at running class discussion and pulls the best out of students. I felt like I was part of the learning experience more than in any other class. Expectations for the papers are really clear and helped me reflect on the readings and the discussion to connect everything together. One of the best profs at CMC,Lisa Koch ,Government department
 GOV60,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Great lecturer. For the most part, mediocre discussion. If i could do it again, I'd take her Russian politics class (her passion and specialty) and take Gov 60 with someone else. That said, she was extremely fair and a very nice person.",Hilary Appel ,Government department

 LIT131,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"Prof. Morrison is a ray of sunshine. Always giggling and very understanding/helpful.

 ECON050,4.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Very easy intro economics class. Not a lot of work and the tests are really straightforward, basically just the problem sets she gave but with different numbers.

 PHYS33,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,Not sure yet,Yes,"honestly professor wells is such a great dude! he has good intentions and is willing to help whenever you need it. i learned most of this stuff outside of class with tutoring and office hours, and he is extremely helpful when you reach out. tests based off in class problems and homework! this class was definitely challenging though",James Wells ,Physics department
 PHYS031,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Setter is a solid choice for phys30/31. It's clear he loves physics and wants you to understand it and likes questions. Sometimes lecture isn't the most helpful bc we spend so long on one example or deriving formulas but the content was mostly relevant. Written and online HW every week with corrections and exams are fair (w corrections too).,Kevin Setter ,Physics department
 CHEM040L,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"The IBC problem sets were pretty packed, but were helpful. He's a great lecturer, sometimes goes fast but he's clear and always willing to answer questions.

Lab was pretty good :)",Aaron Leconte ,Chemistry department
 HIST128,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"By far the most kind professor. A lot of reviews say she's easy (mostly true ), but I'm not a history major so I had to work harder to do well on the essays.

 PHYS33,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"On most test questions you will need to give a free body diagram, have your coordinates right etc. to receive full credit. DO IT!

 ECON101,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Econ101 is lecture heavy she's great at explaining the intuition and giving you real-life examples & detailed notes.

Easily one of my favorite professors at CMC!,Laura Grant ,Economics department
 ECON102,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,"Professor Burdekin was the best class I have taken so far in my Economics major at CMC. He is likely the professor who has most inspired me to go further in my Economics degree. His ECON102 course is focused on learning.

 PPE001,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Hurley is a God (mostly serious). He's interesting enough to make a 3 hour seminar fly by. If you take him, you'll have a lot of great discussions.

I was pleasantly surprised by my final grade.",Paul Hurley ,Philosophy department

 HIST70,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"MUST DO THE READING. MUST GO TO CLASS. She often uses 'guess what I'm thinking' to kick-start discussion, which sucks.

She was my summer internship course adviser, helping me out when I needed one last-minute.",Lily Geismer ,History department
 ECON120,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Raviv really knows his statistics and teaches in a very organized way.

 GOVT144B,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,No,"Professor Sinha's Comparing Social Movements class was awesome.

 HIST103B,5.0,4.0,Yes,,A-,No,"Prof Bjornlie is really enthusiastic about the material and his enthusiasm is infectious. The readings and lectures (more so the lectures) are super interesting.

 PHIL177,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"This is simply not the guy you want if you actually care about the broader implications of the subject.

 PSYC164,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Taking Umanath was a horrible experience. For full participation credit u have to speak at least 3 times a class, in addition to posting 3 discussion questions and 1 discussion response each night. +if you don't say exactly what she wants to hear, u don't get full credit. & despite being a psych, her discussions/acitivities were SUPER triggering",Sharda Umanath ,Psychology department
 GOV149,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,"Professor Taw is a life-changing professor. She is kind, brilliant and funny. Her class develops you as a student and as a person.

 FWS010,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Warner is the BEST! While he is a tough grader, I learned the most about writing techniques and reading styles. He gives detailed & amazingly helpful feedback on papers and will 100% greatly improve you as a writer. The challenge in his class was definitely worth it for the amount I learned. He shares his passion for literature every day!",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department
 LIT105,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Great prof! The first time Professor Rentz read Chaucer's Canterbury Tales in Middle English, all the students were completely mesmerized.

 PSYC030,2.5,4.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"Her intro to psyc is not an easy class.  This course can teach you a lot if you put in the effort, but is too hard for an intro class.  The tests are tough, and it doesn't help that she sometimes gives inconsistent information.  She also constantly tests us on information that is covered in neither the review sheet nor the lecture.",Stacey Doan ,Psychology department

 MATH166,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A+,No,"First portion of the semester was all theory and abstract CS/Math, while the second portion was all about implementation. The theory portion was very difficult for me, but grading was pretty much a guaranteed A, if you did the work. The 2nd half of the class gave me a lot of experience in actually coding all of the theory we learned earlier.",Michael Izbicki ,Computer Science department

 SPAN102,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Velazco's Spanish 102 is my favorite class I have taken at CMC. Although he is not always open to students with views opposing his, he creates a lively discussion and includes many videos in his class. The essays and articles were great preparation for the big paper in the end. Take this class if you're interested in spanish beyond the textbook!",Salvador Velazco ,Modern Languages department
 PHIL030,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Lots of work in weekly readings & essays, but they are interesting. If you do the work and follow the instructions, class is not very difficult. Sometimes she uses difficult vocab, but judges essays only on strength of arguments (not writing style), which is very refreshing. Overall this is an interesting course for intro phil.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 PHIL126,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"She front-loads her Metaphysics class to have some really difficult concepts at the beginning, but if you persist the class is really interesting overall. You have 9 papers (800-1000 words each), 1 group project @ end of semester. Grading is fair but not too tough, and she really loves the subject which makes class great to attend.",Amy Kind ,Philosophy department
 MATH111,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Professor Kao is very helpful in and out of the classroom. Her differential equation class is lecture-based but she will try to get everyone to answer questions and get involved. She gives detailed explanations to theorems and definitions and she is open to questions. Homework is a lot and tough but pretty helpful. Definitely will take again!,Chiu-Yen Kao ,Mathematics department
 PHIL106,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I took FHS and Kant with Kreines, and I must say they are by far the best courses I've taken. Kreines not only teaches philosophy, but also hones the skills how to think in philosophy. He really pushes you on papers, but that doesn't mean you can't get good grades, and definitely not the reason not to take his class!!!",James Kreines ,Philosophy department
 CHEM117,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,"Mackey is a great choice for an o-chem prof. The class is hard, but that's mostly because of the material rather than his teaching style.

 BIO43,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"Prof. Chandrangsu is incredibly kind. He teaches well, gives little work outside of class, discusses interesting concepts, and prepares you for the exams solidly. I have yet to take an exam for his class and not feel confident and ready. He is a fairly tough grader, but the exam material is straight forward and there are never any curveballs",Pete Chandrangsu ,Biology department
 ECON50,4.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Prof. Fernholz just reads off the slides which you have access to on Sakai so you don't really have to show up. The course is test heavy and he doesn't curve so your overall grade is the averages of your tests, basically. Although, he is helpful during office hours and cares about his students.",Ricardo Fernholz ,Economics department
 HIST120,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Livesay is extremely kind and responds positively to even the slightest extra effort by you.  His lectures are interesting, and he definitely notices participation.

 PHIL30,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Dustin Locke was one of my favorite freshmen professors. I was very unsure about philosophy after some extremely boring high school classes, but I loved this class.

I recommend him to all my friends, and added him as an advisor",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department
 SPAN044,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I loved Altamirano's class. She is so funny and knowledgeable. You can tell she cares about her students a lot.

 GOV020H,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Pitney is amazing. If you have any interest in politics, you must take a class with him.

I learned so much in his GOV020H course. Work hard and you'll do well.",John J. Pitney ,Government department
 MATH131,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Rather not say,Yes,She is nice and knows the material well. Her lectures may not be super clear but if you take notes you'll be fine. The problems sets are challenging and exams are reasonable. I'm glad I took Analysis with her.,Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department
 GOV20,3.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Miller is passionate about the founding fathers and principles, and lectures reflect that. Intro to American Politics consists of 2 large research papers and 2  tests (midterm & final- in class essays and short answers).

 FWS010,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,C+,No,"Most of his classes are discussion based, so make sure to read the material in advance. You can get by with just Sparksnoting.

 GOV020,1.0,2.0,Yes,No,B+,Yes,"Avoid this professor at all costs. His lectures are beyond boring, and he reads directly from his notes the entire class without engaging students. I learned nothing, and if another government professor praises Abraham Lincoln for freeing slaves without providing adequate context to the situation, I will lose it.",Mark Blitz ,Government department
 LIT099A,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Professor Smith is hands down one of the best professors at CMC. He kept a really heavy topic of the carceral state super engaging and his deep knowledge of how the world works convinced me to embrace the principles of abolition. Only had one paper, group project, and a couple reading responses. Every CMC student should take his class before grad.",Derik Smith ,Literature department
 MATH030,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Professor Valenza is hands down the best teacher I have ever had.

He is totally worth it.,Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department
 PHYS033,2.0,3.0,Yes,,,No,"Pros: relatively easy(Lab not graded), Lenient in marking tests Cons: Over-complicates simple concepts. When explaining questions, he uses lots of symbols without explaininglabeling. Tends to skip steps(he assumes you can follow his train of thought). Not the most articulate speaker as his voice tends to trail off midway  through sentence. ",James Higdon ,Physics department
 PSYCH140,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Very interesting and engaging. His upper level seminars are brilliant, and he is the sweetest guy. If you ever need help with anything hes got your back. Can't recommend him highly enough, take any class with him.",Daniel Krauss ,Psychology department
 ECON155,3.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Class isn't as hard as many people make it out to be. He's a chill and really nice guy, but lectures were pretty boring and often not very clear.

Spend at least 5 hours before each test and A's will easily come your way.",Matthew Magilke ,Accounting department

Love her!",Stephanie Muravchik ,Government department
 GOV020,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,Prof. Busch is amazing. He is so sweet and I loved his lectures (his Gov 20 class isnt really discussion based).

 MATH111,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"As a prestigious 2.63 GPA Student at Claremont-McKenna College, I'm honored to be writing this recommendation for the Esteemed Dr. Michael O'Nillie.

 GOV80,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Nadon is either the worst professor you've ever taken or the best -- I tend to err on the latter side, but I could see how one could find him offensive.

 PSYC145,3.0,3.0,,,,No,"The Psychology of Morality is lecture and discussion based, and Valdesolo is a fun and engaging lecturer.

 GOVT060,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Loved this class, really interesting, and he's an awesome professor and really cool guy. But he focuses almost entirely on the developing/3rd world (his focus is Latin America)- which I found awesome-, so don't take him if you want a typical, Europe-based comp gov class. He has a very soothing, lulling voice, so be careful to keep paying attention.",Roderic Camp ,Government department
 ECONAS,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,The man's a decent professor.  His tests are a bit tricky because you have to put to use familiar concepts in unfamiliar ways sometimes.  That's a good thing.

 CHEM015,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Professor Sanii is super nice and he gives great lectures. He does lots of fun demos and he makes class interesting. He is always willing to help and going to his office hours is always useful.,Babak Sanii ,Chemistry department
 ECON50,2.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"He is a pretty funny guy who likes to take things easy.  Gives everyone 100% on all assignments and projects.

However, enjoy his sense of humorandhis 100% hw.",Meric Keskinel ,Economics department
 CIV10,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"If you aren't looking forward to taking Civ, take nichols. He doesn't hold you responsible for the reading and he is an easy grader.

She requires her students to respect the educational experience in her class, which is too much for some.",Ann Meyer ,Literature department
 GOV20,3.0,3.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,Really nice and interesting person. I recommend you go to lunch with him when he offers. There's a good amount of reading in the beginning but it gets easier. Had daily quizzes and then daily debates. We read a lot of supreme court cases.,Jay Martin ,Government department
 AST66,1.0,5.0,,,,,"an absolute nightmare.  I took this class for fun and ended up correcting him on every detail nearly half the time.  His tests were inacurate and he expects you to do most the learning on your own.

 RLST143,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Davis is a GREAT lecturer and is always open to comments/questions, which he answers with clarity and respect.

 CHEM117,2.0,5.0,,,,,"He is a teacher that expects a lot, and classtime does not seem very well used.  If you are a huge nerd who wants to live/breath ochem I think he would be a GREAT prof.

 CALC30,3.5,3.0,Yes,,,No,"Not much to say. Gives prequizzes, helps those who need it although be it reluctantly as he expects you to immediately grasp the concepts.

Pretty hard to do well.",James Pinter-Lucke ,Mathematics department
 HIST162C,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Rosenbaum is a fantastic professor if you're interested in the material.  He knows his stuff and will go out of his way to help you learn.

 MATH30,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,The class is easier if you've already had calc before. Watch out for tough tests and some crazy problems in homework assignments that aren't covered in class.

 FREN132,2.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,Strict grader.  Did not give clear instructions on assignments and gave a penalty later.  Participation matters.  This prof was under the impression that there was some lack of motivation and gave me low grades.,Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department
 PSYCH40,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Took for stats and cog psych. Would not recommend for stats. Lectures and HW were pretty easy but did not leave with a solid grasp of statistics after taking the class. Tried to teach R instead of SPSS and that led to a lot of trouble. Cog was easy class. Tests came pretty much from class handouts and a couple questions from textbook.,Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 RLST153,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Not my favorite professor. He did not guide discussion well, he assigned a TON of reading and writing, and did not seem responsive to his students. He is knowledgable about the topic for the most part, but I did not enjoy the class",Kjell Lejon ,Government department
 BIO44,5.0,1.0,,,,,"GREAT class. It is incredibly interesting for anyone who is interested at all in questions about the origins of humanity and life.

 PSYCH50,3.0,1.0,,,,No,"Class seemed to improvise structure. But I liked that the class was almost completely discussion based and he is really open to having you participate and share your personal opinions.

 ECON050,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Bird has a very different teaching style. He expects you to read long, dry chapters before each class, and then answer his very difficult in class questions that stress him out. Hard grader.

 BIO80,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"A great teacher. The class is hard though, although the bad grade was largely my fault.

And they're usually short--another plus.",Melissa Coleman ,Biology department
 ECON86,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"I had no real knowledge of accounting before this course. I got a good amount out of the material and am glad that I took this class.

Overall good course",George Batta ,Economics department
 CIV10,2.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Essay prompts are confusing and unclear.  She gives papers back with no feedback except for the grade.  In her office hours, she is intimidating and hostile.

I would not recommend this prof to anyone.",Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department

 CS51,1.0,4.0,,,,No,"Literally the worst class I've ever taken. If you don't understand something and go to his office hours, he makes fun of you / criticizes you for not paying proper attention rather than helping. I used to be so interested in this subject...but I'm not taking any more CS classes, at least, not with him.",Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department
 HIST167,1.5,4.0,,,,No,"Extremely boring. Assigns very dense readings. Discussions and lectures have little structure, and grading is very arbitrary (not easy either, as some people would have you believe). Nice and eloquent, but confuses you with various muddled theories so you end up not knowing what you should take note of. Would not recommend.",Nita Kumar ,History department
 SPAN44,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"She is a great professor. Learned a lot about Latin American literature and history, plus improved my Spanish writing ability. In class, she is very patient and open to answering questions. Always welcoming during her office hours.",Lee Skinner ,Modern Languages department
 CALCII,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,This Professor is amazing. He is ready to give as much as time as you want will explain you the silliest of things if you have a doubt without a sign of grudge on his face. You should definitely take him if you gte him. I would have liked to take him for my Calc 3 as well. His tests are slightly tough you should get an a with hardwork.,David German ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"It is true that Professor Broussard only teaches off of power point, but I don't think that was a hindrance to the class. She holds office hours twice a week and really encourages students to come in. She is funny and engaging and I thought she was a good teacher overall.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department
 ECON102,4.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Extremely helpful and nice in class, after class and during office hour. Work as a group for the biweekly assignment and go to the tutor session for help. Rachel is the best tutor ever. Shelton's class is not that hard, but he expects you to understand the theory and use them  for the exam. Only essay questions for the exam, no easy ones. ",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department
 BIOL173L,4.0,1.0,,,,No,Very easy course!,Jonathan Karpel ,Biology department
 GOV60,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"I was extremely disappointed with Prof Pei's class. He is unquestionably a brilliant scholar, but his teaching style would be a much better fit at a large research institution. Quality discussion during class was non-existent, and he was unable to provide any constructive feedback during office hours. By far my most frustrating class at CMC.",Minxin Pei ,Government department
 CHEM14,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,do not take this class. it made me hate chemistry. i put a ton of time and effort into this class and it didn't pay off. class just made the material more confusing and he expected you to know material he didn't teach nor was in the book. worst professor ever. nothing about this class was good.,Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department
 CHEM14,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"She is awesome! I was dreading taking chemistry class, and now I am dreading not having her as my teacher.  She is there for the students, and her office hours are fun and helpful.  Take her if you have the chance!!!",Kayla Kaiser ,Chemistry department
 ECON070,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,No,"Professor Binay is my favorite professor at the 5Cs.  It possible to do very well in this class if you work hard and go to EVERY class.  If you put the time and energy in, you will learn A TON from taking his course.  He is a really great guy, very approachable,  and wants his students to learn and succeed.  Highly recommend him for any class. ",Murat Binay ,Economics department
 PHIL033,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Political Philosophy was an amazing class! I had no prior background in philosophy of any sorts, but just because of this one class, I am now considering adding Philosophy as a major. This course requires you to spend about an hour reading and thinking about the texts before class. In class, you have very stimulating conversation. Tough grading.",Andrew Schroeder ,Philosophy department
 ARTOFATTENTION,5.0,4.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"I understand why Leland has gotten average ratings, as he is a very difficult grader and expects a lot from his students. However, as a Lit major, he has inspired me to be a better writer and look for art in everything I see; what more can you ask of a professor?",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department
 FSW,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,good course,Evan Kindley ,Literature department
 MATH030CALC1,1.0,5.0,,,Rather_Not_Say,No,"This professor is the worst professor at CMC. He doesn't teach the material properly, won't respond to questions that he deems ""too simple"" and his exams are too difficult and testing you on topics he hasn't even taught in class but expects you to know on your own. Prepare to teach yourself all the material and still expect a D in his class.",David Krumm ,Mathematics department
 HIST125,1.0,4.0,,No,,Yes,"Do yourself a favor and don't take this class. I took it because I heard great things about her (great prof and reasonable grader), but after she received tenure, she's gotten so much harder. Unclear with guidelines, arbitrary grading, lots of reading. One of my least favorite classes I've taken at CMC.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department
 ECON101,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,No,I love Professor Tocoian. She's super helpful during office hours and will review things in class if you're confused about something. Work hard and you'll be rewarded. Lectures are pretty straight forward since she prints out the notes for class and you just fill them in. Would definitely recommend!,Oana Tocoian ,Economics department
 CHEM14,4.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,Bad for a GE but great if you actually want to get to know the material. He is a very difficult test grader but it's only because he wants you to truly appreciate what is being taught. Very helpful in and out of class and definitely willing to help if your grades have fallen in a hole.,Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department
 MATH55,5.0,1.0,Yes,,,No,Lectures are super clear because she writes every important stuff down on the blackboard. Easy class with minimal homework and fairly easy tests.,Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department

 GOV20,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Prof. Rose is one of the most talented teachers I have had.  Will definitely challenge you  to contribute, to think, and to improve your writing skills.  Really keeps the course current and relevant,  which breathes life into course work.",Shanna Rose ,Government department
 HIST100,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Professor Hopper is clearly the expert on the subject matter that he teaches. Discussion was always lively.  I had him for Logic of War, and the simulation at the end (effectively replacing a final examination) was one of the most fun experiences I've ever had in a classroom. Though there are no tests, he is not an easy grader on papers. ",Ian Hopper ,History department
 CHEM116,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,She's absolutely wonderful. My favorite professor! She's so kind to students and is ALWAYS available in office hours and usually by email. She goes out of her way to help her students because she GENUINELY CARES. Her lectures are clear and she makes good analogies to help you understand difficult concepts. Made Ochem my favorite class!!!,Neeraja Dashaputre ,Chemistry department
 BIO171,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,One of the most inspirational teachers I have had here at the Claremont Colleges. Prof Cohen makes you work for it so be ready to ask questions and see him if you have any questions (he's more than willing to meet with his flexible and extensive office hours). You will not only learn a lot about the course material but also how much you can achieve,Joseph Cohen ,Biology department
 ECON125,3.5,3.0,Yes,,A,No,"Vossmeyer is probably the best professor to take metrics from. She's super smart and will help you if you seek her out, but she also legitimately loves metrics so she'll teach you as much as you're willing to learn. She's reasonable about the work and she wants you to do well. She's also pretty hot.",Angela Vossmeyer ,Economics department
 CHEM116,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,B-,Yes,"She is so cool and I really enjoyed HER, however her lectures were regurgitating the book and her expectations were not clear. I studied soo hard and always did meh on exams, which were difficult. She is great in office hours, but it was so hard to get a read on what to do for this class. She is a fun and helpful lab prof, but not great for lecture",Brisa Hurlocker ,Chemistry department
 CSCI055,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Straightforward midterms and final. Tough grading especially for partial credit. Midterms and final questions have long and very tedious solutions so use a calculator, manage your time efficiently, doublecheck your calculations and go to office hours before exams.",Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department
 HIST134,4.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"She'd make a phenomenal professor a few years from now. The effort she put into every class was obvious and she loved the material despite not being an expert. That said, her grading criteria was pretty hard to ace and were graded ridiculously harshly. It was impossible to score below a B and above an A-, no matter what you did.",Chelsea Wang ,History department
 BIO044,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,B+,Yes,"Taking this class has been the worst decision of my college experience. prof gilbert doesn't lecture clearly, nothing makes sense when she talks. class is often spent doing absolutely nothing. there have been at least 7 times where i have sat in class for the full hour and 15 minutes and we go over absolutely nothing. don't take this class.",Princess Gilbert ,Biology department
 BUSLAW,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"I loved Prof Taylor! A total badass- could kill Jack Bauer in a barfight. He doesn't waste time or tolerate not doing the reading- but he's very helpful in office hours, and I think he's very funny and interesting.",James Taylor ,Accounting department

 ECON101,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"He is a nice guy and teaches things very clear. Lecture slides are updated on sakai weekly. His lecture is slow-paced and easy. If you want to learn a lot then don't pick him but if you like a easy ECON 101, he would be a good choice.",Jeffrey Flory ,Economics department
 FHSCULTPOLIT,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Fantastic professor, really wants you to understand the material (note that the material he selects is absolutely excellent too). You will learn a lot and come to appreciate his anecdotes. Well travelled and highly intelligent. Extremely helpful and available. Lots of reading, papers and tests graded harshly (he has high standards for his students)",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department
 ECON086,4.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"It's impossible to describe Ganguly. His videos are helpful and its great that you can go back to watch them, but this class is just so much work (really, if you want to do well, you will will easily be doing 12+ hours a week). He will seem pretty tough at times-don't take it personally. Enjoy his little catchphrases, and learn lots of accounting.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department
 GOVT095,4.0,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Prof Rossum is probably my favorite prof so far.  He is clear, intelligent, and experienced.  Intro to Law has been an amazing experience, there has been a ton of reading.  At one point, I had two days to read a 350 page book, so get ready to hunker down.  Also, he makes his right-wing political views quite apparent, especially when not asked.",Ralph Rossum ,Government department
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,No,Awesome Professor. A must take. Not too much homework. The homework is important and is meant to help you.

 ECON152,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"A very organized Professor who really knows his stuff. He makes handouts for every single chapter that make it really clear what he will be testing you on.

 RLST171,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,"Professor Espinosa is a prof you take for a class you are truly passionate about. Taken as a GE, it can be a crapton of work and unless you go to his office hours you never seem to know what he wants out of a paper. His Religion & Film class was cool as it encompassed film techniques too but was 4 hours long on Thursday nights! Get ready to write",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 PSYC030,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,Her classes are structured really well for the entire semester: 2 midterms and 1 final (which was another midterm). It's important to listen in her lectures and do the reading to understand for the next class. She really cares for her students and is very proficient at teaching.,Catherine Reed ,Psychology department
 ECON050,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,It was my first time taking Econ and Ozbeklik made it a fun experience. The tutoring hours helps so so much. No need to read the textbook because his lecture presentations are straight from the textbook and clear enough. Do all that he says while preparing for the midterms and you will be alright. If you don't his midterms are going to seem so hard,Serkan Ozbeklik ,Economics department
 ECON101,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Professor Lincoln was great, however, expect heavy lectures and over 70% of your grade to be from two tests. He is the most clear and accessible professor however, and teaches you so many valuable concepts.",William Lincoln ,Economics department

 ECON134,2.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Fan Yu is a really nice person. Lectures were boring. Grade is based on tests and case studies. Tests and case studies were hard, much more difficult than the problems from lectures. Nice grader",Fan Yu ,Accounting department
 ECON050,3.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,Very difficult to get an straight A in. Some things on tests were harder or different than the homework problems and lecture notes. Class average going into final was a B- and 2nd test average was a 71% with no curve. Definitely need to study and do lots of practice problems for success.,Mary Evans ,Economics department
 HIST055,5.0,2.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Ferguson is universally liked for a reason.  Not the BEST!!!!! teacher I've had, but good.  She plans the course to teach you things, not to give you a grade.  Easy to get an A or a B/B+.. she says so at the beginning.  Lots of readings.  A class where you get what you want out of it (get out what you put in).  Go to office hours for papers.",Heather Ferguson ,History department

 AISS1,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Gould is very helpful, particularly when it comes to scheduling office hours and helping with homework and computer programming issues.

 GOV020,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,"Really smart and passionate about government but his class is the same (lecture) every day. Why have a class of 10 students if it's just a lecture? Tough grader and there are like 2 assignments the entire term other than reading, so it's hard to do well.",Giorgi Areshidze ,Government department
 RLST010,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,Michon teaches everything in Sanskrit so you have to learn another language while learning the material. he is super passionate about the material but does not teach it in an interesting or clear way at all.

 GOV149,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Prof Koch has been my favorite prof I've had in college. She's so incredibly smart and passionate, but so willing to break down concepts for the class.

Approachable & accessible during office hours and very clear about grading criteria",Lisa Koch ,Government department
 GOV60,2.0,4.0,,,,No,Very disappointed in the class. Like an AP Comp Gov class. Couldn't answer basic questions. Frequently hadn't thought about issues raised by students. Tests were nitpicky and didn't test broad comprehension.,Hilary Appel ,Government department

 ASTRO66,3.0,4.0,,,,No,"Tests consisted solely of material covered in class.  Took COPIOUS notes, but found the tests difficult (got low B's on both).  Thanks to labs, I ended up with an A.  He was genuinely interested in the material and helpful in office hours, but very hard to pin down a meeting time with.  Overall, he was an OK prof.",Steve Naftilan ,Physics department
 MATH160,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"I had difficulty understanding the material at times but eventually did after putting in the work. His lectures were pretty much the same as his lecture notes, so what I would do was try to absorb as much as possible during lecture, carefully read the lecture notes, then go to office hours to ask questions. This worked well for me.",Mark Huber ,Mathematics department
 LIT139,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,"Prof Morrison is such a lovely guy, he is organized, funny, and clearly passionate about film theory.

He will read your drafts and give you feedback and makes paper prompts very open ended.",James Morrison ,Literature department
 ARBC001,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Bassam made me feel like our class is really a family. He's one of the funniest, kindest, and sweetest teachers I've ever had, though his class can be a little chaotic or confusing at times. Arabic is a really challenging language, but nobody loves the subject more than him. Be sure to take advantage of the tutoring hours outside of class.",Bassam Frangieh ,Modern Languages department
 LIT10,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Adored Professor Crockett. She chose interesting readings, and I looked forward to the class everyday (even though it was at 8:30 AM!)

Highly recommend her!",Christine Crockett ,Literature department
 ECON101,4.0,3.0,Yes,No,A-,Yes,"This class was by no means an easy Ayou have to work pretty hard and seeking extra support.

If you're an econ major looking to build fundamentals for future classes, definitely avoid.",Saman Olfati ,Economics department
 PHYS33,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"How do I even begin? This class made me lose my will to live. His lectures consisted of him reading directly off his PowerPoint, & the lectures had no correlation to the material on the homework or the exams. He yelled at us for not knowing and understanding material. If you want to learn, you have to teach yourself. This class made me miserable.",James Wells ,Physics department
 IBC01,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Leconte is quirky and hilarious, so he can make boring chemistry topics fun. He expects a lot from his students and is nit-picky with grading.

His review sessions are very helpful",Aaron Leconte ,Chemistry department
 HIST119,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Prof Selig is compassionate and caring. She makes her class discussions accessible to everyone, and I always looked forward to coming to class.

 LIT91,5.0,2.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Von Hallberg is the best lit professor in all the 5 Cs. I'd HIGHLY recommend his poetry classes. He's super knowledgable, kind, and respects his students. He isn't a hard grader and is very understanding about extensions on essays. Often goes on tangents but they're all very enjoyable. You learn much more than what you signed up for. ",Robert Von Hallberg ,Literature department
 PHYS034,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Very very organized.  Great teacher though extremely  difficult. Very helpful.  Gives lecture notes out, but for that reason does not give study guides.

 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Professor Grant is my fav! I wouldn't say her class is ""easy,"" but she does a great job of explaining the intuition of concepts you will need in future Econ classes.

Weekly open-note quizzes, three problem sets and three exams total.",Laura Grant ,Economics department
 ECON135,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"No homework, good professor, and clear grading criteria. Class is just hard because it is just midterms. Overall, glad I am taking it.

 PSYC030,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"It's not too much work for an intro class and she grades you on 5 short essays, but she has unclear/specific grading criteria that make getting an A pretty difficult. She is sarcastic and strict with participation. She's not super sensitive or nuanced with some of the topics in psych like mental disorders, gender, etc. so just be aware of that.",Tomoe Kanaya ,Psychology department

 GOV60,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A+,Yes,Professor Sinha is an incredible professor! I would highly recommend taking her GOV60 course.

She is extremely helpful in office hours! Highly recommend! ,Aseema Sinha ,Government department
 FHS010,2.5,3.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"You can totally tell that he is passionate about Ancient history! I would, however, not recommend him for an FHS professor.  Discussions became lectures where he would just ramble on for what seemed like hours. He assigned a lot of reading- so much so that none of us could ever complete the HW. Essays prompts were way too confusing.",shane Bjornlie ,History department
 FWS010,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Respected and published professor who knows what he's doing. Course work for FWS Post Apocalyptic Narratives was not bad. Two major papers, three short responses, one short story. Do not expect to get better at writing unless you put in the work by meeting with him at office hours. Need to be a good writer to get a grade. Not much writing help",Kevin Moffett ,Literature department
 PHIL165,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Rajczi is worth taking. Class discussion is well-led for the most part, subject matter is interesting, and the man is cuttingly bright.

 PSYCH164,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I love Professor Umanath. Took her autobiographical memory class and she is top of the top. She knows her stuff and is so passionate about it.

However, if you are not a strong writer in literary criticism, his papers are hard to do well on.",Seth Lobis ,Literature department
 FWS1,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Very knowledgeable. It is possible to get an A, but you must work for it. He always opens up extra office hours and is very helpful.

Very often goes off task and never really completes all the tasks on the syllabus as it says.",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department
 FWS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Took Monsters FWS. FWS is a course really nobody wants to take but you have to. That being said, she made the content interesting and I genuinely feel like my writing improved. Not too much workload (30-40 pages per class) and 3-4 medium length papers throughout the semester. She is super nice, understanding, and cares about you.",Ellen Rentz ,Literature department
 PSYCH30,1.0,5.0,Yes,,B+,No,Nothing about intro to psych in this class. Whole bunch of videos and her own research articles. Not what was required for intro to psych. Waste of time.

 PHIL030,4.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,"This class pushed me in the best way possible. The class is hard, but Prof. O helps you become an incredible writer.

She is a really tough grader but the class is so worth it.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 FHS105,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Kind's FHS class (Life, death, and meaning) is amazing. If you like philosophy at all this is a great class to take. She grades quite fairly, an average paper is a B, a good one is an A-, and an A is reserved for the really really good ones. The class has a lot of reading and 3 difficult essays, so its a bit of work.",Amy Kind ,Philosophy department
 MATH31,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Her lectures are not very clear and she is not good at explaining problems. Homework is assigned for every class and it is graded. She emphasizes learning definitions of concepts and tedious proofs, which are very unnecessary. However, she is accessible outside of class and tries to accommodate students. Tests questions are similar to hw problems.",Chiu-Yen Kao ,Mathematics department
 PHIL106,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,No,"Truly brilliant scholar and fantastic at helping you make sense of the toughest pieces of philosophy.

 CHEM116L,3.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Professor Mackey's could be a little clearer in lecture. Often he gives a lot of examples but doesn't really explain the grand scheme of things.

 FHS010,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,B,No,The class consists of very long readings and it is a discussion based class. The professor provides very rude and unacceptable feedback; the feedback consists of insults rather than constructive criticism.,Peter Uvin ,Government department
 BIO143,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"If you read over the textbook before lecture, you should be fine. The problem sets are definitely challenging but if you go to office hours (she has multiple every week), you should be able to get 100 on every problem set. The tests are not unreasonably difficult and if she feels that anything has been given unfairly may offer extra credit.",Findley Finseth ,Biology department
 ECON50,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Really great professor. Cares about whether his students understand the material conceptually; which is all that you really want out of econ 50.,Ricardo Fernholz ,Economics department
 HIST114,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"He is very specific about what he wants in papers, and that generally includes a learning curve, but when you get the formula down it's not very difficult. Half the class is discussion based on the assigned reading and half of it is material he brings up in class. Great history prof and such a nice guy!",Daniel Livesay ,History department
 PHIL038,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"He grades on the level system so there are no midterms or finals, but the levels are definitely tricky and he can be very picky. The readings were SO interesting and I loved class discussions. If you go to his office hours he is very clear and it definitely helps! Overall a great prof with an amazing class but can be picky",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department
 SPAN044,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"I enjoyed taking Professor Altamirano's Spanish 44 class. It wasn't a difficult or stressful course, but I saw my Spanish significantly improve.

 MATH32H,3.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"MATH32H with Prof. Aksoy was a very difficult class for me. Lots of homework and generally quite difficult. The in-class notes are LONG. You can easily fill up more than a few pages with notes during a typical class. However, Prof Aksoy is accessible outside class and the tests are fair, albeit difficult. If you put in the effort, you will be fine.",Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department
 GOV20,4.0,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,"I'm still confused as to whether he is a good professor or not. Miller is a good professor in that he's very helpful when you get hold of him and that his assignments and grading standards are reasonable. However, he has too much on his plate and is very hard to get hold of. His lectures can be boring. Not a bad professor but not the best either.",Ken Miller ,Government department
 SPAN33,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Carlos is the best Spanish professor I have ever had. He is incredibly caring and I have so much respect for him.

 FHS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Students will take lead a class discussion and the nice thing is that you get to choose when in the semester you do this. You can get away with not reading the entire text as long as you read a summary and you don't even have to participate much to still get a good grade. Very understanding as long as you communicate with him, has good vibes.",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department
 GOV20,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Pro: He makes you understand the material and reading. You will learn a ton. Con: Generally boring class periods. He isn't too nice and he has high grading expectations.

 PSYC070,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Awful teacher, nothing in his lectures is reflected in his exams. Class is set up so poorly. Gives you writing assignments that can be answered in two sentences. Incredibly unreasonable about everything. His tests are not reflective of his lectures at all.",Daniel Krauss ,Psychology department
 ECON150,3.5,5.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Hard class but you will learn more in this class than you have in most, he is one to throw curve balls and arguably expects too much from students, but nonetheless you will certainly learn accounting.

 GOV020,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Professor Muravchik is a gem. She is very kind and if you put in the effort, she is always there to guide you.

Get to know her outside of class.",Stephanie Muravchik ,Government department
 GOV020,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Really enjoyed this class - I'd 100% pick him as a gov20 prof for 2 reasons. 1 because he knows his stuff and it's really interesting to hear him talk about it (gov department chair & rose head) and 2 because it isn't that much works (readings are pretty much optional, and midterm is take home). Overall, I really enjoyed the class and am learning!",Andrew Busch ,Government department

Discussion heavy class, 2-4 papers total",Esther Chung-Kim ,Religious Studies department

My French definitely improved after taking this course.,Marie-Denise Shelton ,Modern Languages department
 GOV60,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"This man is shher brilliance. His comparative govt class made me switch advisors; he is also my thesis advisor.

I love this man; he's been the most amazing professor.",Roderic Camp ,Government department
 ECON101,2.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Do yourself a favor. Find another professor to take 101 with. Tests are a total grab bag as to what forms of problems will be used. Does not curve.

 CHEM015,4.0,3.0,Yes,,B,Yes,"Sanii is the professor you wanted to be and wanted. He is super inspirational and tries very hard to engage his students in the material.

 CIV10,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Smart guy. Is obviously interested in the books he chose and knows alot about them. If yo don't do the reading, you can get by. It's more interesting if you do though. Was on friday at 10 which was less than ideal, but a pretty good teacher. Papers were really easy. Just pay attention in class, and expand his ideas.",James Nichols ,Government department
 RLST161,3.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Teaches an interesting course. Very knowledgeable, yet somewhat condescending. Erratic instructions and expectations. At times very friendly and others moody and snippy.

 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Many says that he is hard and bad. I agree that he is not easy, but he is a really good professor. He knows what he is talking about.

 FHS,3.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Martin is a very sweet man who knows a lot about different subjects, but he tends to ramble on during class discussions.

Easy class overall, but not very invigorating or interesting during class lectures.",Jay Martin ,Government department
 PHYS30LAB,4.5,4.0,,,,,Prof Dershem seriously wants you to learn-- my group was the last to leave lab every time and he still kept his patience.  Very tough to get a good grade but if you ask for help he will give it to you!  A really nice guy!,Thomas Dershem ,Physics department
 RLST43,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Great professor.  Knows his stuff.  He cleans up most of the reading in his lectures and makes it understandable.  He keeps the class pretty basic and not extremely demanding, though there's a decent amount of reading.  Good for a GE, and a great religion/philosophy professor.",Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department
 MATH111,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Very interesting class.  Did not use textbook all the time.  Book was hard to understand and he did a great job explaining.  Suggestion:  Go to his office hours.,Mario Martelli ,Mathematics department
 PSYCH065,2.0,1.0,,,,No,"I had a huge interest in Behavioral Psychology. This class was a waste of time in terms of information learned. The material we covered over 1 semester could be taught in 2 class periods. Literally. Huge disappointment, because I actually wanted to learn. However, she is charismatic, hilarious, & entertaining. Easy elective, if ur looking for one.",Marjorie Charlop-Christy ,Psychology department
 HIST176,2.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"I don't care if Constitutional History is your favorite subject - think very carefully before you take this class.

 ECON101,2.5,3.0,,,,,Antecol was all about proving microeconomic theory rather than explaining its significance.

Overall the class seemed disorganized.,Heather Antecol ,Economics department
 GOV70,1.5,5.0,,,,No,"a good man, and clearly brilliant, but its  apparent that he is no longer fit to teach. forgetful when it comes to details as to what you have done; the writing process with him is infuriating; his goal teaching writing is to create intellectual clones of himself. his comments are incomprehensible, and meeting him for feedback is equally as useless",Edward Haley ,Government department
 MATH30,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,This class was amazing! I really would take my next calc with this professor if he would teach one. He always gives prequizes and its pretty easy to prepare for them.,Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,4.5,1.0,,,,No,class was interesting and straightforewatd. he told a lot of jokes about college students being hungover 24/7 but whatever.  I liked the class a lot because all problems could be solved by understanding the 3 or 4 graphs per chapter.  I would take again given the chance.,Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department
 ID109,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"One of my favorite music courses.  Gratz is really a nice guy, and a wonderful musician. If you don't go to his concerts and you don't participate in class, you will not do well. He is a fair grader and it is possible to get an A if you do the work. And his class is interesting.",Reed Gratz ,History department
 LITSECT,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"One of my those life changing professors. Really listen to her, and take the time to prepare thoughtful class discussion topics and essays, and you will benefit as a student and as a person.

 FHS10,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Extremely insightful and knowledgeable professor. If you're interested in East Asian philosophy/history, you won't be disappointed. However, if it's not your cup of tea, the class may seem very dry. Participation is important so read the material before class and be prepared to discuss.

 ECON86,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"if professor Massoud didnt have such a great reputation, rosett would be regarded as one of the best professors in the department. hes an amazing guy- he likes to challenge his students, but that just makes you perform at a level you never could have expected of yourself. amazing man.",Joshua Rosett ,Economics department

 AISS001,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Not the best lecturer but really helpful and painfully nice and funny. Has gotten better in lecturing since the first semester and more organized, but can still sometimes go off into tangents. Office hours are helpful though if you want more clarification. A fun person to talk to as well, and is overtly nice and cute in a motherly way.",Gretchen Edwalds-Gilbert ,Biology department
 GOV125,5.0,4.0,,,,,"One of the best professors at CMC. An excellent leader of the program and a sharp mind. Be cautious if you cannot defend you views well.

 -Ditto on the sometimes mind-numbing lectures
 -I consider myself a good writer and still got low B's and an A on three of my papers (dont have the others yet)

 FREN33,3.5,4.0,,,B,Yes,"Maybe it's because she was forced into teaching the class, but ugh. She means well, but she doesn't explain things well and didn't understand that this was the first time most of us had learned this material (FREN22 did not prepare us well).

Tried to blame quietness of class on Asian stereotype--only sore point.",Wei-Chin Hwang ,Psychology department
 ECON350,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Bird is thorough and tough, but he knows his stuff and will teach you well.  His lectures are far from boring, which is saying something when it comes to Global Finance (dull).

 BIOL80,2.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"This class is way too hard for a non-major GE, way harder than most other sciences.  Most of the labs were pointless and some of thes were really long.  She might be great for science majors, but if you want a good grade, I don't recommend her for a GE.",Melissa Coleman ,Biology department
 ECON86,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Accounting is a demanding class regardless of which prof you take it from, but if you go into his office hours and send him e-mails he will get back quickly.

 ECON102,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,The lectures are fabulous. A very humorous professor who is very experienced in teaching and research. His experience with the Fed and IMF makes his lecture very interesting.

 ECON50,1.0,4.0,,,,No,"This is bar none the worst professor in the economics department. While her work may not be super challenging, she is clearly uninterested in the student and makes it clear by rarely holding office hours or conversing with students on her time. At a school where over 90% of the professors are TEACHERS, she is a RESEARCHER. Skip this one.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department
 196,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Econ 196 was the best class I've taken at CMC. Even though the subject matter is extremely difficult, Professor Shelton takes them time to make sure everyone is on the same page.

Professor Binay is really helpful and approachable.",Murat Binay ,Economics department
 LIT058,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Leland is extremely insightful. He does not dumb down his insights.

 CHEM15,2.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Tests are similar to practice exams, office hours are helpful. He is a lovely chap in general but I dislike his teaching style.

Your textbook will be your best friend in this class.",Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department
 MATH030,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"She's pretty goofy in general e.g. we take a break in the middle of a 75 min class to look at a math comic/video that a student shares to earn a dropped HW. Her class is pretty slow-going and she let's you have one page of notes per midterm (easy), 3 pages of notes for the final (harder). Slow class, but Needell is funny and sweet.",Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department
 FWS,3.5,4.0,Yes,,,No,"Very smart and insightful, expects students to read as in depth as she does. Lectures drag on as they are mostly comprised of her analyzing the poems and stories listed under the syllabus. A lot of reading expected.",Kathryn Stergiopoulos ,Literature department
 HIST100,4.5,4.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Hopper's class was engaging and challenging. He grades essays harshly but is very willing to help if you go in to talk to him.

 GOV95,4.0,3.0,,,B+,Yes,"Definitely one of the smartest and most well known (especially in the law community) professors at CMC. Genuinely nice guy, and is much better in office hours.

 ECON101,4.5,3.0,Yes,,A-,No,"Bjerk makes micro as interesting as a micro class can be (which imo is not the most exciting subject). He is super clear, his slides are very understandable, you do not need to read the book, let alone buy it, and the workload is light. His tests can be tricky and conceptual, but people have gotten 100% on them too.",David Bjerk ,Economics department
 ECON152,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"Definitely take Finley for Tax Planning. He was once a Tax Professional, so this is his area of expertise, and he truly displays it.

Highly recommend!", Andrew Finley ,Economics department
 CHEM14,1.5,2.0,,,B,Yes,"Boring lectures. He makes fun of people and answers questions with rhetorical questions.

 FHS010,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,B+,Yes,"Professor Espinosa's class was easy enough but extremely boring. He talks a lot, it was all lecture and I would not recommend it. There are also papers due every two weeks that just felt like busy work.",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 PSY96,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"I love Dr. Reed! Once I got the hang of the class, I really enjoyed her teaching and the material.

 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"If you take the initiative to do the practice problems, understand the homework, study the lecture slides, and go to office hours, the tests aren't that hard and you will definitely succeed.

 GOVT20,4.0,2.0,Yes,,A-,No,"Assigns a ton of reading, but he's an easy grader. If you're not motivated to prioritise the class you can still get a decent grade without doing the readings. Funny guy, obviously been there awhile. Took us out to pizza before the final, very approachable and easy to talk to. Understands if gov isn't your major. Teaches interesting concepts.",Charles Kesler ,Government department
 MATH060,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Nelson is currently my favorite teacher CMC. He is extremely kind and helpful outside of class.

 HIST55,5.0,3.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,One of the best professors I've had in college. She's deeply passionate about her material and really wants to share it with you.

Brilliant and wonderful. TAKE!!,Heather Ferguson ,History department

When I will grow up, I want to be like Professor Koch!",Lisa Koch ,Government department
 GOV60,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"I did not enjoy her Gov 60 class. The class was discussion based and she had too much tolerance for mediocrity. She lets students ramble on and on who obviously haven't done the reading and are also off-topic. She didn't seem that knowledgeable herself about the topics we covered either. Decent class, not great.",Hilary Appel ,Government department

 MATH160,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,B-,No,"The class is really difficult if you don't intuitively understand the material, because he understands it very well and assumes you do too.

He's also not the most helpful guy in his office hours.",Mark Huber ,Mathematics department
 LIT138,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Jim Morrison is the man! Very kind, funny, entertaining, and class material is interesting with great film choices.

The class was very test-heavy, which did not match well with my learning style.",Saman Olfati ,Economics department
 PHYS033L,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,"What an awful introduction to college physics! In his defense, Professor Wells seems to be knowledgeable about the topics, but he cannot teach in the slightest.

Ugh.",James Wells ,Physics department
 CHEM040L,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Very good lecturer, but not willing to answer super specific questions in class. His office hours are the best; very personable and quirky.

 ECON186,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,B,No,"Grant is overall a nice lady, just not the best prof. This class was trying to do too many things, and was not very organized. There were two ""quizzes"" and we had little-to-no resources to actually know the material. She sometimes gave us study-guides with wrong answers. There are alot of readings, which i liked. Final is a paper, which is not bad",Laura Grant ,Economics department
 ECON102,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,No,Great class. Prof burdekin is a really nice professor and if you work hard enough and study your notes it's possible to get an A in the class. Extremely helpful in office hours. Wants students to do well,Richard Burdekin ,Economics department

 HIST124,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Geismer loves history. She also pushes her students. The class fundamentally changed the way I think. She doesn't lecture so reading is imperative to a beneficial experience.

Essentially if you work for her, you will love your experience, but she does expect a lot.",Lily Geismer ,History department
 ECON120,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,No,"Worst, worst, worst professor at the 5Cs. He really doesn't know what is teaching. Content is way harder than parallel classes. His horrible accent makes his class not understandable at all. More importantly, he doesn't know what is pace. He goes really fast with his super hard content, no one is motivated to learn. Avoid him!",Yaron Raviv ,Economics department
 GOVT139,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Professor Sinha is by far one of the top three professors I have ever had. She cares so much for her students' success that she will do anything in her power to help them.

Expect a lot of (rewarding) reading.",shane Bjornlie ,History department
 PHIL34,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,"Rajczi is an awesome choice for a philosophy prof. Since you're probably going to need to take at least one philosophy class in college, and every class you take is going to have a huge lecture component, you should choose the one that's most interesting in class, and that's definitely Rajczi.

 GOV70H,3.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,Absolutely don't recommend taking 70h over 70... not much gained and 70h is significantly more difficult with much higher expectations.  Taw can be interesting & is very knowledgeable.  One frustration for me was that lectures simply rehashed readings which felt like a waste of time.  Very opinionated - always agree w/ her/write what she wants!,Jennifer Taw ,Government department
 FWS010,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Professor Lobis is an incredible seminar leader. He takes the class dive deeply into the material and discover aspects and beautiful nuances which hardly any of us could even think about.

 FWS1,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"If you want to become a better writer, take Prof. Warner. His feedback can feel nit-picky, but it is always specific and helpful. He invests time in his students.

 CHEM117,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Mackey's lectures can be soothing to the point of sleep, but he has great OH and is actually really funny. He pretty much just goes over the book which is too bad, but he knows his stuff. His exams are either easy or hard... rarely in the middle which is hard to predict! Solid choice for a professor. WAY better than most new profs. Fun for lab too",Joel Mackey ,Chemistry department
 FHS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Uvin (former Dean of Faculty which is why he has so few ratings) is amazing! It's about development.

 BIOL143,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"While it's true that the lecture can go a little fast at time, the slides are online so you can easily review them.

 RLST135,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"I was mislead when looking at RLST classes. Here is the truth. Professor Gilbert is caring, intelligent, and the most boring lecturer I've ever encountered.

Caring, easy, BORING!",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department

 PHIL170,3.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"do NOT take this course to satisfy a GE or for an intro philosophy course. concepts are extremely hard to grasp and the reading is dense and circular. prof davis does a decent job explaining some of the material, but not all of it. he's a nice guy, though, and will help if you ask. if you're really into philosophy, this might be a class for you.",Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department
 PSYCH,2.5,4.0,,,,,"Too stringent with following the rules, nearly to the point of being anti-compassionate.  Reasonably clear with expectations, but not very approachable.",Shana Levin ,Psychology department
 MATH111,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Very focused and interesting.  Book was boring and incomprehensible, but he did not use it all the time.
 Cute teacher.  Helpful.",Mario Martelli ,Mathematics department
 PSY65,3.0,2.0,,,,No,"This professor is fun and certainly knows her stuff. Her knowledge of behavioral psych and its application i.e. with helping the autistic kids in her clinic is an opportunity that claremont college students should really consider. Sometimes she is late, or absent - that is true. The class is simple though useful.",Marjorie Charlop-Christy ,Psychology department
 GOV20,2.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"A very sweet man with a voice that can lull a child to sleep. That being said, he expects a lot out of you and definitely expects you to do the reading. Class discussions are pretty dry as there are usually only one to two people who did the reading or are interested in the class.",Charles Lofgren ,Political Science department
 CHEM116AND117,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Awesome experience, loves his subject, and it shows!He teaches you how to critically think, instead of sheer memorization.  Learn the concepts and you'll do well on the tests...that's it, plain and simple.  Takes a lot of time to do practice problems, but my friend and I did ****loads of practice probs and the tests were easy,nothing unexpected.",Kersey Black ,Chemistry department

 GOV70,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Expects a lot of his students. Do the reading, if you don't and try to BS an answer during class he will call you out. Very much discussion based. Extremely helpful during office hours. He made me change my major to IR and is now my adviser.",Edward Haley ,Government department
 MATH30,3.5,1.0,,,,Yes,He's not very nice but tries to help in his office hours and over email or even on the phone. Super lenient on grades. Gives a ton of make-up opportunities. And it's quite true that he doesn't really cares about the students b/c he says a lot that he knows the majority of ppl in the class only take it to fulfill GE.,Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,4.5,5.0,,,,No,"material was straightforward and easy, tests were very tricky and difficult, prof w enjoys throwing curveballs and phrasing test questions poorly to throw off students, tests are worth 85% of your grade and since he likes to be tricky and no straightforward on tests, the course can be quite difficult",Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department
 ID109,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"I took this class thinking it would be easy, but anyone who says it is easy is CRAZY. His tests are difficult they made me want to cry--which is ironic, because music is supposed to be fun. But he is into small details and I just could not follow him. Not too many papers/tests, but grades very harshly.",Reed Gratz ,History department
 LIT000,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,I took Feminist Theory from Prof. Bilger sort of because I felt like it was something I ought to do before graduating from Scripps.  It ended up completely changing the way I view the world.  It was empowering in the most amazing way.  The material is great and Bilger lets the students take control of class discussions.,Audrey Bilger ,Literature department
 MATH31,2.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Very tough to follow; lectures often have little to do with homework and tests. The book isn't much help.,James Pinter-Lucke ,Mathematics department

 ECON86,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"A good teacher. Better than average. Also very friendly. His corny jokes really helps me get through 3 hours/week of numbers and words. He teaches most things clearly, but if anything is confusing, he doesn't clarify any better, even if you ask him during office hrs. Tests strongly based on class notes-not too bad. Accting is sometimes interesting.",Joshua Rosett ,Economics department
 MATH30,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Terrible Prof. She will make you hate math. Her problem is she relies way too much on the text for her explanations and makes everything more complicated than it has to be. Don't take her for intro courses,Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department

 LIT10,5.0,4.0,,,,,"I thought Prof. Bradley was great.  His class a great way to start out your college experience because he doesn't torture you. I loved his reading list. I found his class to be kinda hard, but some kids that think they know everything think it is easy. He's very helpful and easy to approach.",Adam Bradley ,Literature department
 POLICYANALYSIS,4.0,4.0,,,,,"Haskell never gets the praise he deserves.  Most students who complain don't like him bc he won't let you get away with BS in his class.  He's funny, witty, and makes you work hard.  Yeah, his grading's tough and the budget is boring, but he is a great prof. who calls people on their BS.  I found it refreshing.",John Haskell ,Government department
 ECON134B,3.5,5.0,,,,No,"Best class at CMC. Work hard, prepare the cases and she will respect you for it. She will cold call you and if you say something stupid be prepared to get grilled. Great prep for the real world.",Lisa Meulbroek ,Economics department
 GOV20,4.5,3.0,,,,,"Uhlmann is very willing to help outside of the classroom. He is also a very accomplished politician and very knowledgable. (he was special assistant to Pres. Reagan!) His lectures can be long, but if you do the reading and ask questions it's much more interesting. This class is better for those who like gov. We had three tests,one paper, and a fina",Michael Uhlmann ,Government department
 FR44,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,I loved her! She was very helpful and definitely took note if you were proactive. I went to office hours and sent her lots of drafts for my papers and received good grades on them because she saw I was working hard. Overall awesome prof,Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department
 PSYC109,2.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"I don't know what your other options are, but I do not recommend this professor.  Like others have said, he's a good speaker, but literally nothing he says makes sense.  Really bad at explaining the material and answering questions.  I learned from the book.  His tests are full of errors and poorly written.  You'll survive, but it will be painful.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 RLST174,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,He is an excellent professor!,Kjell Lejon ,Government department

 SPAN44,4.5,3.0,,,,No,Great professor. Seems very intimidating but by the end of the class you will love her! Go to class and study your practice tests and you will be fine! Highly recommended.,Maria Martinez ,Modern Languages department
 ECON50,1.0,4.0,,,,No,"He is not helpful at all! He doesn't answer questions ever and gets frustrated and a little angry if you ask any. His quizzes and tests are not impossible if you study what you've done in class, but it's not worth how boring and unhelpful he is as a prof. Everyone falls asleep in his class. Bird needs to learn to ANSWER QUESTIONS!",Graham Bird ,Economics department
 BIO161,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,She is a wonderful teacher. She really cares about her students and goes out of her way to make sure they are learning as much as possible. She lives basically on-campus so is very available for office hours pretty much 24/7 when you can make it. She also invited the whole class over and cooked us dinner.  She is overall a wonderful lady and makes ,Melissa Coleman ,Biology department

 CIV10,3.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"She has the most work out of all the Civ10 teachers.  She is a very hard grader on everything you turn in.  She expects you to read about a book a night.  She's a very smart teacher.  You learn a lot, but your grade suffers.  I wouldn't suggest taking her if you are looking at Civ10 as an easy class.",Jasmine Aimaq ,Civilization department
 PHIL95,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,Took Prof. Gardner for Philosophy of Mind and Fundamentals of Logic- two of my favorite classes thus far.  Prof. Gardner is thorough in his explanations and very open to questions/discussion. Hes energetic and makes class fun! Tests aren't easy but if u pay attention its doable. Be interested in the subject or you'll struggle to enjoy it/keep up.,Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department
 CSCI51,5.0,2.0,,,,No,Art Lee is a very effective professor. His lectures are clear and illuminate the subjects. His problem sets do an outstanding job of helping me internalize the material. If you are interested in CS this class will be both easy and super helpful.,Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department
 HIST160,3.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"Took South Asian Hist. Through Literature. Could have been awesome, but her goals: teach us that there is no unified ""indian culture""/grand narrative. She's opinionated and not always available. She's upset because CMC won't let her teach w/in her specialty, which is education and Russian history/language/government.",Nita Kumar ,History department
 SPAN155,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,Skinner is an awesome proff. very enthusiastic and friendly.  Will help you a lot! Class was relatively easy if you keep up with readings which aren't very difficult at all.  She offers to proofread and lets you rewrite your paper if you messed up on some.  Overall awesome teacher. Best for Spanish in CMC and all other 5C's,Lee Skinner ,Modern Languages department
 ECON50,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,I really enjoyed this class. Prof is really cool and she gives you her notes. If you keep up with the reading you'll be a-ok. She also posts previous semester's tests so you know what format the test is in. Much easier than other econ profs.,Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department
 ECON102,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Best professor I've had at cmc. His class is really hard, his tests are challenging, but he gives a nice curve. Even with the curve, though, his class is hard.  You will, however, come out knowing more about macro than students in other macro classes. Take this class if you want a challenge AND you want to learn a lot.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department
 GOV60,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Pei is brilliant, clearly an expert in his field. LOTS of reading, but bulk of class is based on lecture so if you come to class it's not hard to get by without doing the reading. Work load not bad, two short essays and five quizzes. He is super nice guy too and very understanding. Pei is a boss, take this class with him!",Minxin Pei ,Government department
 CHEM14,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Not the best at teaching chem, but if you want to get your science GE out of the way, take Kojima. He is the man. Super cool guy, just wants his students to understand what's going on in class and pass. MasteringChem sucks though -- WebAssign is much better.",Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department
 ECON134,5.0,2.0,,,A,Yes,"If you work hard, getting an A isn't very difficult since most of his stuff is from online and even so, he always makes time to help you if you ask. He's very understanding and reasonable.",Murat Binay ,Economics department
 FWS,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Very intelligent but poor teacher. Class lectures were great but was really divergent, never knew what he was trying to do in class. Completely unhelpful outside class, hard to make appointments beyond office hour. The amount of writing was fair  but paper topics were vague and he grades harsh. Love his dog though.",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department
 FWS,3.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,He is nice. Lecture is a little bored. He knows more than he talks.,Evan Kindley ,Literature department
 MATH30,2.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Not a good professor. He wants you to understand, but his teaching style isn't good. His midterms are hard and he doesn't curve the class, so no only is it hard, but its also tough to do well in.",David Krumm ,Mathematics department
 FHS010,5.0,2.0,,,A,Yes,"LOVE HER!! She is always willing to help and is very very clear during in-class lectures. She'e not a harsh grader, but I definitely felt like I got a lot out of her feedback on my essays. She also didn't assign too many essays, which was nice. I highly recommend her.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department
 ECON101,2.0,5.0,Yes,,B,No,"boring - literally talked half the class to sleep every time. made me sad except when she brought candy to class. homework was ok, midterms were insanely difficult and unrelated to what we covered in class. no word in English language to describe what final made me feel",Oana Tocoian ,Economics department
 CHEM014,4.0,2.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,He is hilarious in that he makes these awkward not funny chemistry jokes that are just plain cute. He is a good chemistry professor i think and he really tries hard for his students to succeed in his class. Prepare yourself for weekend exams!,Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department
 MATH30,3.0,2.0,,,B+,Yes,She is brilliant. However she is fairly new at teaching. She goes very slowly in content and starts back in a comprehensive algebra review. I know for myself this was very helpful. She is a great teacher but could still use a few more years under her belt first.,Deanna Needell ,Mathematics department
 LIT091CM01,4.5,3.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"She is passionate and (maybe too) intelligent and gives incredibly insightful analyses of the poems read in class. She is sometimes unclear and makes minor changes to the syllabus often. We got through few of the poems assigned because the class was so discussion-based- more guidance may have been good. Hard grader, great feedback. Would recommend.",Kathryn Stergiopoulos ,Literature department
 HIST151E,3.5,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"I went through liking, hating, then loving Hopper. He is young and quite funny, but a little condescending with the subject. This is his territory and he's very proud of his knowledge. However, he is SO available to help. Which is good, since he is an extremely tough essay grader. It's a lot of work, it was a pain at times, but I ended up loving it",Ian Hopper ,History department

 CSCI055,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,"Prof Shaar really cares about his students and is always open to discussing the material at the end of class or in office hours. Even though a couple 20 point tests and a 40 point final make up majority of your grade, he shares the question topics prior to the test. He also even offered an extra credit opportunity to get a couple test points back.",Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department
 ECON86,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"an incredibly dull prof and horrible for intro accounting. he writes illegible chicken scratch on the board and glosses over material, assuming students know how to do it. by the 3rd week, attendance was down to less than half. that tells you something about his teaching and the class. he likes to make students feel stupid and he's just a sourpuss.",James Taylor ,Accounting department
 FHS,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"The only discussion based class I had freshman year. I didn't take a single note. A LOT OF READING, IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A GOOD GRADE ON THE ESSAYS, yet if you're into the topic, it is the most intellectually stimulating class you'll get. This is the class that I'm learning the most, even though its kicking my ass.",George Thomas ,Government department
 ECON173,2.0,5.0,,,,No,"Had no idea what he was doing. Took a really interesting subject matter and made a complete debauchery by assigning unreasonable amount of work that was not even stimulating.  Class was very disorganized. Its sad because he's a good guy and obviously really smart, but unfortunately still hasn't got a hang of teaching undergraduate level courses.",Jeffrey Flory ,Economics department
 HIST146,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Petropoulos is a fantastic professor and is extremely well versed in German history.  His lectures are extremely engaging, and he really works to make you excited about the material.  Expect to read a TON in his class (~300p/wk).  Papers are graded very fairly, tests very harshly.  As a result, I recommend taking him for a seminar class!",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department
 ECON86,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,Yes,"I wish I had taken this class earlier! It is by far the most applicable class I have taken in college and Professor Ganguly is an amazing prof. Hes tough, the class is A TON of work but you leave really knowing your stuff!",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department
 GOVT153,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"While Rossum's lectures can be a bit dry, he really knows his stuff, and he'll try to make it interesting as often as possible.  His passion for the subject (the American Founding) was evident, and made the subject much more enjoyable.  Assignments are minimal.  He grades fairly, and is lax on due dates.  Overall, one of my favorite profs at CMC.",Ralph Rossum ,Government department
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,,,No,"I just loved his class. One of the BEST classes that I took at CMC. He is a great lecturer. Simply by showing up to the class and sitting there, you can learn a lot. (Of course you need to work to get an A) His tests are pretty straight forward, and he lets you bring a cheat sheet. I'm definitely going to take this class again!",David Bjerk ,Economics department
 ECON086,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,He's still a new prof. Could definitely spice up his teaching style. Cannot tell what is or isn't important based on lectures. I feel like if I went to more office hours I would've had a better idea of what he expected., Andrew Finley ,Economics department

 FHS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"Very great person (empathetic and willing to compromise). One of the most caring professors I have. As for class, it can get boring since you just discuss what you read but usually he is the one who does all the talking. Many readings assigned although many are interesting. Only write a paper every other week. Try not take advantage of his kindnes",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 PSYC30,2.0,4.0,Yes,,A+,Yes,"Warning: this will be the most boring class you will ever take. Avoid at all cost. Prof Reed is not good at teaching, and she goes off topic all the time during lecture.",Catherine Reed ,Psychology department
 ECON050,3.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Class is lecture style with power points, but gives students power points beforehand so class can be kind of boring. No surprises on tests if you go through past quiz questions and practice questions. Straight forward class, but not the most invigorating professor.",Serkan Ozbeklik ,Economics department
 ECON101,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Great Prof! He is always approachable and can explain concepts very clearly - this is also due to the clear structure of his class. I would for sure take any other class that he teaches.,William Lincoln ,Economics department
 GOV20,5.0,3.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,"Prof. Kesler is a very helpful and nice guy. Very approachable to students and don't make you stupid or intimidated to talk to him and ask him questions.

 MATH060,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,No,"Linear Algebra with Professor Nelson is definitely a great experience as far as you don't miss out.

Sam is a very nice professor and definitely one of the best in CMC. Definitely recommend!",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 GOVT109,4.0,1.0,,,A,No,"Juvenile delinquency is an interesting topic, but this course taught me nothing. It was mostly logic and people telling irrelevant personal stories.

 ECON050,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Mary is difficult but the BEST option for a freshman that wants to major in econ. Granted, other professors might be rumored to give you an easy A, but Mary will prepare you so well for a future in econ. Lectures are straightforward and organized and I struggled but I learned so much. Take this class if possible!",Mary Evans ,Economics department
 55,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Easily the most underrated professor at CMC. Brilliant, invested in her students' learning, understands how to ask questions and teach students without telling them. Class discussions could perhaps use a bit more intervention from her, so students expect greater rigor and think harder about the reading before showing up",Heather Ferguson ,History department
 PHYSI010,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Fine,Scot Gould ,Physics department
 BIO143,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Doctor Ferree got some hate in the past...that was solely because he was a new teacher and not used to teaching. I have had him for 3 years and seen his progression in his teaching style.  This year he was the frickin bomb, take him!",Patrick Ferree ,Biology department
 GOV020,4.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"A very intense teacher who is passionate about the subject and expects a lot from his students. Different from other GOV20's, involves a lot of reading/similar to political phil. Great teacher and class.",Giorgi Areshidze ,Government department
 FHS10,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,"I'm personally confused as to why Michon has a 2.8 in terms of difficulty. FHS010 was one of the most unrewarding classes I took because he essentially lectured the whole time and shut down anyone who had opposing opinions and thoughts. I thought the readings and content of the class was enjoyable, but keep in mind that he is a name-based grader.",Daniel Michon ,Religion & Philosophy department

Highly recommended!!",Hilary Appel ,Government department
 GOV104,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"I have overall enjoyed almost everyone govt prof I have had. Courser is the exceptional. He managed to take a relatively interesting and simple topic and make it mind-numbing and more complex than necessary.He assumes that everyone has taken stats, when most of us had not.

 LIT137,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I LOVE HIM. Bio major, but had him for my FWS and took him again for my Lit GE (U.S. Gay & Lesbian Film) because he is so amazing.

Almost switched my major after taking his classes, I loved them so much.",James Morrison ,Literature department
 ARBC001,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,What a professor Bassam is. I challenge anyone to someone better anywhere. He's the most passionate guy around and he genuinely (seriously!) cares about his students.  And he's a brilliant and respected scholar too. The course is pretty hard but courses like this are honestly why you even come to college.,Bassam Frangieh ,Modern Languages department
 FWS1,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Professor Crockett is a wonderful professor. She is the head of the Center for Writing and greatly works to improve writing and analytical skills. The texts she chooses are very interesting. She individually sits down with you to go over papers and truly cares about how her students do in the class.

 PHYS33,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"I have personally never had such an awful academic experience. This class shattered my love for physics. I came in as a confident physics major but this prof made me doubt myself in every way possible. He made me feel inferior, unintelligent and incapable.

 CHEML040L,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I really struggled with this class in the beginning but Professor Leconte made a point to reach out and help me get back on track.

 FHS,5.0,1.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Professor Selig was an incredible professor that provided readings that were both fascinating and intellectually stimulating.

Tests are very rigorous.",Laura Grant ,Economics department

 ECON120,3.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Professor Raviv is very nice and willing to help. With that being said, his class is very confusing and the lectures do not do much for you.

She is willing to help in every area, whether it comes to understanding a difficult topic, or writing a paper.

As a Science student I would put the workload slightly below that of an into science course, however, it is also an amazingly immersive class where if you put the effort in, you can learn a lot.

Also, the class is heavy on proofs.",Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department

Beats me, but you can see for yourself.",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department

 GOV80,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Amazing teacher. Teaches political philosophy in the way that I was used to taking literature classes. All about textual analysis and extrapolation.

 LIT63,1.5,2.0,,,,,Seems to be very hit-or-miss. She loves butt-kissers. Do not question her statements (especially if you're right & can prove it) or she will hate you.

 GOV20,4.0,1.0,,,,No,Super laid-back gov 20 class. Took as a GE because I had no interest in the subject at all. Only downside was daily quizzes but definitely better than having huge exams to study for. Very easy class and good discussions in class.,Jay Martin ,Government department

I ask him a question about the final paper, base my entire paper on it, then he tells me 1 day before it's due that he wants something else!",Edward Haley ,Government department
 CALC1,4.5,1.0,,,,No,Didn't crack open the textbook. Make sure you take notes during his lectures and listen to his tips. He gives a practice quiz for everything and just changes the numbers around so review that. Easy A. Doesn't need much time. No need to go to office hours. Good if you memorize patterns. Realizes he blocks the board and types out notes for you.,Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,4.5,2.0,,,,No,Really straightforward material that is easy to grasp if you have any mathematical ability.  You don't have to read the text to get a decent grade just go to class and take good notes.

 CHEM14,3.5,4.0,,,,,"Hatcher Skeers is a very good teacher. Although the tests are tough, if you do the assigned readings and assignments, it isn't that bad.  Your grade defenetly reflects how much work you put into the class.",Mary Hatcher-Skeers ,Chemistry department

 GOV125,4.0,4.0,,,,,"Contrary to the previous reviews, Spalding actually expects you to know your****. So come to class prepared, do the reading, and be able to defend your arguments.

It's all grammar.",Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department
 PSY109,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"At first, I was excited to go to class because the teacher seemed interesting. He might be a good orator but nothing he says helps clarify or exemplify the concepts unless you read the book beforehand. So, it is a hard class that requires a lot of studying, but he doesn't help reinforce it as well as he could. No practice besides doing the homework",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department

 CS61,3.5,3.0,,,,No,"He has a lot of industry experience and it shows. He knows what he is talking about most of the time.

 HIST51,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Usually I don't take the time to write these reviews, but this teacher is ridiculous.  Yes, this class could potentially be interesting but the amount of reading is a little over done.

 ECON86,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"some people disagree with me but i thought prof taylor was very good. He applied accounting to the real world and got me real interested in it.

Don't get me wrong - she is super nice and cares a lot about her students, but her lectures are too dry. Some people say she is easy - not necessarily. I find her midterm questions confusing. ",Catherine Reed ,Psychology department
 ECON50,3.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Although he is nice, I found his exams to be much more complicated than his lectures and homework even after a lot of studying. There are a lot of trick questions and you basically work down to the very last minute. Having said that, this is a relaxing class with not that much work, but once again the hard tests really limit how well you do.",Serkan Ozbeklik ,Economics department
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Super nice professor! Very straightforward, with clear expectations. He sometimes gives interesting examples and stories. He is very patient, and would not mind explain concepts in more details during office hours.",William Lincoln ,Economics department
 GOV20,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,Most brilliant professor I've ever encountered. simplifies incredibly complex topics on a daily basis. Almost problematic how easy he makes teaching an intro class look. Highly recommend.,Charles Kesler ,Government department
 MATH31,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Really nice guy, super helpful in office hours. Homework every week (except before midterms). Extra points on homework will save your grade. Writes on board, you just have to copy it. Easy to skip class. Sit up front if you can, he can be hard to hear in some classrooms. Has his own textbook, gives it to you for free. Get ready for math jokes.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 GOV105,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"He talks for the entire 2.5 hours of each class (or sometimes shows dated documentaries). He throws ~300 readings at you at the beginning of class and isn't really clear about when/what to read. Your grade consists of 2 papers, one of which is supplemented by a debate, with an optional 3rd interview paper. Would not recommend.",Frederick Lynch ,Government department
 ECON050,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof Evans is a god! Prior to econ 50, I had never taken econ before. Her class was well-structured, entertaining, and engaging.

She is very approachable and helpful during office hours as well.",Mary Evans ,Economics department

 PHYSICS3334,5.0,5.0,,,,,"Best teacher I've had at CMC so far...really good instructor and great guy to get to know.

Professor Gould is a hard teacher with hard tests, but I don't think you can ask for an easy Physics test??",Scot Gould ,Physics department
 BIO43,3.5,2.0,,,,No,"He is super nice. He is very interested in his students doing well and will look at your grades specifically to give you what you deserve. He only tests you on what he talks about in class. I only read the book when I didn't understand something. He lecture are fairly clear, but his powerpoints are pointless. Helpful in office hours.",Patrick Ferree ,Biology department

 FHS10,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"At first I struggled A LOT in the class. But Prof. Michon is an AMAZING professor and each class it is just so interesting everything he teaches us & he makes it interesting. He is super nice, accommodating, & approachable.

 GOV20,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Intelligent. Seriously cares about her students. Fair grader and is very clear in terms of grading and expectations for her students. Super helpful during office hours!

 GOV143,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Don't let my ratings fool you; I thought she was a great prof. She wasn't a pushover like many of the profs here. Her assignments, reading, and grading were reasonable and interesting. Beware if you don't read: she calls on people that don't talk. She really nice and incredibly smart, though. Highly recommended!",Hilary Appel ,Government department
 GOV20,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"He knows the topic amazingly well.  It's a tough class, but you will learn a lot and the readings alone are reason enough to take the course.  He is not very friendly, a tough grader, and it seems like he tries to make students feel inferior.  He's smug and arrogant and not that helpful if you don't get it right away, but he does know his stuff.",Zachary Courser ,Government department
 ASTRON66,4.0,4.0,,,,,"He's awesome!  He makes class interesting with all sorts of random, funny stories about the various crazy scientists he's met in his lifetime.  He's also a great lecturer who knows his stuff and can explain it with all sorts of examples we, as non-scientists, can relate to.  His tests can be hard, b",Steve Naftilan ,Physics department
 MATH31,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,A-,No,"Huber rounded a 92.9% down to an A-, really not fair. He also doesent include participation points. He makes blatant errors in the lecture notes, so I am sure he graded the finals slopely and cheated some students out of points.",Mark Huber ,Mathematics department
 FWS10,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,Professor Morrison is awesome and one of the best professors I have had at CMC. His lectures are interesting and cover material that many students have not read/watched.

 ECON50,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,Extremely straightforward quizzes and tests. Do the suggested questions and you're guaranteed a 100 in every quiz. Midterms are easy enough if you study exactly what she tells you to and go by the checklist provided. Good class for a solid A and a good ECON50 foundation.,Saman Olfati ,Economics department
 PHYS033L,3.0,4.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,"The class content was not hard for a person who took Physics in High school but Professor Wells made it so tough. He doesn't put much emphasis on Quizzes and they are a bit easy. His Homeworks are long, tough. His midterms are very very tough. The good thing is that he curves the final grade, which makes people better grades than they expected.",James Wells ,Physics department
 BIOL040L,4.5,4.0,Yes,,,No,"Great lecturer. He goes through concepts really fast though and is reluctant to answer questions extensively in class. His problem sets are also time-intensive. However, he is very patient and approachable during his office hours. You will work your butt off but you will also learn tons.",Aaron Leconte ,Chemistry department
 FHS,5.0,3.0,,,,No,Selig is AMAZING!! This has been by far my favorite class and favorite professor at CMC. She got me so interested in the topic of gender that I might do a gender sequence. She isn't an easy grader on papers (but isn't too hard either) and is very helpful and accommodating. TAKE THIS CLASS IF YOU CAN!!,Diana Selig ,History department
 AISS1,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Landsberg is a GREAT prof. His lectures are clear and make hard stuff really easy. Expect lots of really annoying problem sets, but they do help you out on tests.

Definitely take one of his classes if you can.",Paul Hurley ,Philosophy department
 PSYC30,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Super enthusiastic, puts a lot of effort into her classes.  Class is interesting, she uses a lot of videos and activities.  Her class is harder than I was expecting for Intro to Psych, you have to do a ton of memorization for tests and lots of obscure questions, grades papers fairly hard.  She's a great lady though, I would recommend her class.",Tomoe Kanaya ,Psychology department
 HIST100,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"My favorite class in college so far! Class was entirely based on discussion, so be ready to have an opinion. She graded papers pretty hard, not impossible to get an A if you work. Helped me understand the modern politics and basic contemporary american history as well as teaching me to form my own opinion of historical events. very enlightening!",Lily Geismer ,History department
 ECON120,1.5,5.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,"Has a thick accent which is tough to understand and doesn't really explain anything.

 FHS,2.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"The lectures are extremely unorganized and confusing, and very dry. Very little participation. No real structure. Don't discuss most of the readings and they are extremely long and time consuming. Not a great class and honestly would not want to take another class with her. She is a nice lady however. Very boring.",Aseema Sinha ,Government department

 PHIL198,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"He is hands down my favorite professor. I've taken three classes with him, soon to be four. He makes difficult material easy to understand and is always available to speak in office hours. He's also really funny!

 FWS010,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,No,"Lobis is possible the biggest slayer out there, in a good way ofcourse. Taking his class really popped my bubble and thrust me into world of college writing.

Go to his office hours; listen to what he has to say about your writing!",Seth Lobis ,Literature department
 LIT119,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Warner is tough and very critical of writing at the sentence level. Some might call him nitpicky, but I think it does help improve your writing. He's very accessible outside of class and cares a lot about his students. Old and conservative, gets very excited about his stuff. The Russian Novels class is in my top 10 favorite classes of all time.",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department
 LIT110,5.0,2.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Ellen Rentz is wonderful; she can occasionally get frustrated with students but the frustration clearly comes from a place of high expectations and respect and most of the time she is incredibly  kind.

 PSYC030,5.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"I think people don't like it because it's not an easy class. But if you put in the effort, you will learn a lot. She also curves the final grades! She uses video clips, to make class entertaining, and posts slides.",Stacey Doan ,Psychology department

 CSC42,2.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Disorganized lectures, midway through the semester after a midterm realized how little content I have learned from the course.

 SPAN6504,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,I enjoyed the reading and discussion.,Salvador Velazco ,Modern Languages department
 PHIL030,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"The class is very intellectually challenging, yet extremely rewarding. Discussions were engaging, material was interesting, and lectures were clear.

She challenges students to think for themselves.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 FHS01,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Great facilitator of discussions. It's easy to get away with not doing the readings, but they are pretty interesting and you'll get a lot more out of the class by doing them. Definitely go to office hours, she'll go over your papers and tell you what you need to fix.",Amy Kind ,Philosophy department
 PHIL30H,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,The most fun and interesting class this semester. I loved the discussions in and out of class with this professor and the rest of the class. The prof really appears to respect every student and takes all arguments very seriously.,James Kreines ,Philosophy department
 BIOL143,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"She's a very nice lady outside of class, but her lecturing style is terrible. She is extremely vague in her lecture slides, and the weekly problem sets are a nightmare. She goes very, very fast and skims over things but then later tests you heavily on really difficult problems she didn't even go over in class. I wouldn't recommend her for Genetics.",Findley Finseth ,Biology department
 ECON50,4.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Fernholz is a great guy. Very light on math, but HEAVY on conceptual thinking (which is harder than it seems if you have never taken Econ before). Little homework, but the tests are difficult, and his curve system is helpful for those doing really poorly but not ones in the middle. I would recommend his class, but it will likely not be an easy A.",Ricardo Fernholz ,Economics department
 PHIL038,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Professor Locke is so passionate about the material he teaches and makes everyone else passionate about it too.

 SPAN033,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Altamirano is a fair grader who really cares about her students.

 MATH131,3.5,5.0,Yes,,B,No,Asuman is a great professor that really cares about your learning. The class is just so hard because the material is so dense and boring. She will help you if you seek her out but she moves fast so keeping up can be an issue late in the semester. Required for most people but if you like theoretical math you should take her anyways.,Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department
 GOV20,5.0,3.0,,,B+,Yes,Very fascinating professor. A great teacher who knows his stuff. Hard to get an A but easy to get a B/B+.,Ken Miller ,Government department
 SPAN022,3.0,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,"The class is not hard, tests are very fair and not much HW at all. He is a great guy, but not the best teacher ever.

He is a kind man who wants his students to succeed!",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department
 LIT130,3.0,2.0,Yes,No,,No,"Very participation heavy, which I personally wasn't a fan of but many people enjoyed.

 FHS010,4.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"He assigned 8 essays for the semester, but 6 of them were short and the other 2 were the midterm and the final.

I definitely would recommend.",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department
 GOV80,3.5,1.0,,,,No,"How can you fully engage in this absurdly boring class. Don't read the books - he goes over everything 10 different ways in class.

 LIT99,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Prof Smith gave me a different way of thinking about life and history. He connected historical events in my mind that were never connected and literally made me think differently about how change is affected.

 MATH030,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"This class is basically review if you've taken calculus before.

Tests are very similar to the homework problems. Sometimes goes off on tangents, but is very chill",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department
 PHYS34,1.0,3.0,,,,No,"had to learn it all on my own.  he is the worst explainer ever. when you ask a question, he just repeats what he's said before because he doesnt know the answer.  he also spends half the time insulting students, thinking it's funny.",James Higdon ,Physics department
 PSYCH70,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"My favorite class I've taken so far at CMC. Very well organized course,superb content. Tests are very difficult and its necessary to put in a lot of work beforehand.

Don't come for an easy A, come to learn.",Daniel Krauss ,Psychology department
 ECON155,5.0,3.0,,,A,Yes,"Magilke is an excellent professor. His lectures are methodical and emphasize practice problems, which I found incredibly helpful.

 HIST150E,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE PROFESSOR CODY! Even if she was teaching a class over a subject I absolutely hated, like math, I would still take the class just to have her as my professor.

She is the nicest professor and definitely recommend!",Lisa Cody ,History department
 GOVT20,3.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Muravchik is very nice, but it seemed like she struggled with not having enough time to prepare the curriculum for this class.

That's not horrible (it was fun), but I would have liked more basics.",Stephanie Muravchik ,Government department
 GOV20,4.5,3.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,"I love Busch - I think his lectures can be a little boring, but it's Gov class where you LEARN GOV.

 ECON86,4.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Put in the work, and getting the A is no big deal. The people who say Massoud is hard are the people that don't try at all. He's a legend for a reason.

TAKE HIM (if you can get in, which is tough)",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department
 PSYC01,1.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"You may not have any other options, but avoid this professor if you can.

Also, Mr. Nadon cold calls on students which is intimidating.",Christopher Nadon ,Government department
 FREN135,2.0,5.0,,,,Yes,ugh: that's what i would think before each class. she's very intelligent  but intimidating. cross examines you in class whenever you comment on something and expects you to participate alot. difficult to understand her rapid accented french. massacres your essays but helps improve your writing. makes you do a 25min presentation in french. hard prof,Marie-Denise Shelton ,Modern Languages department
 GOVT60,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Camp is the most pleasant and approachable prof I've had.  I didn't have a lot of interest in the subject, so the lectures and reading were a bit dull, but it's worth it.

Best part: he sometimes holds class at his house, with brownies and baclava!",Roderic Camp ,Government department
 CHEM015L,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,One of the best intro science professors! He is a very fair grader and is very receptive to student feedback. He is also very approachable during office hours.

 MATH111,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"Pretty easy if you read the notes and make an effort to understand them. He wants students to understand the material and do well, so the class is both helpful and easy.

HOWEVER, he provides no structure in his class, does not give clear advice on what he wants and grades like a mo fo, out of nowhere.  Worse than Weintstein.  He's a terrible teacher.  FIRE HIM.",John Haskell ,Government department
 ECON134,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"great course, case study method so there's a lot of work every week. she can be intimidating but she's nice if you can show her that you know what you're doing. no final exam, only a final group project, so overall, the workload is a lot more than for other classes during the semester, but slightly less work at the end of the semester. good class!",Lisa Meulbroek ,Economics department
 FR44,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"LOVE HER! geniunely wants to help students (will correct your essay 4 times if you send it to her before turning it in) - keeps class interesting, does her best to have everyone participate - take a class with her you won't regret it!",Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department
 PSYCH111,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"I wasn't a fan of the group project, but he really helped my partner and I hone in our experiment and get all of our statistics in order.

 ECON145,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"He can be boring during lectures but if you actually go and talk to him during his office hours, he's very helpful.

But you've to read the class materials carefully though cos he's a strict grading style.",Sven Arndt ,Economics department
 SPAN44,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Martinez is amazing! She is so sweet and funny, and really helpful. Class discussions are mandatory so be ready to talk A LOT. You write a lot of short essays, and one longer 5 page essay at the end of the semester. Altogether, a great class, and easy to get a good grade if you participate in class, and do all the assignments.",Maria Martinez ,Modern Languages department
 ECON50,3.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"Mr. Bird is an adorable british man who constantly tries to keep his class entertained with silly jokes. I wouldn't recommend his econ 50 for students looking to learn as much as possible, but he is entertaining and good grades are easily attained as long as you speak up in class, laugh at his jokes, and read the text every once in a while.",Graham Bird ,Economics department
 PHIL30,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Great professor. Really helps you learn, and very dedicated to making sure the class understands everything. The tests were somewhat difficult at times, but he's very reasonable if you want to dispute any of the questions. Reading isn't very necessary, and you'll do well if you just study the class notes before the test",Thomas Gardner ,Philosophy department
 CS62,1.0,4.0,,,,No,I used to love CS. Now I dread the subject. Homeworks take forever and he doesn't understand that we have a life outside of his class. His exams test you to see if you can be a compiler. Useless.,Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department
 HIST51,1.0,2.0,,,,No,"Nita Kumar is by far the worst professor I have ever taken at CMC. She is opinionated and biased, she spends most of the class time trying to convince us to believe her conspiracy theories without any form of reasonable proof. Unless you enjoy getting frustrated by bias opinionated teachers, DO NOT TAKE HER CLASSES.",Nita Kumar ,History department

There is no way to guarantee a good grade in this class, just try to understand everything",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department
 GOVT142E,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,Very clear and interesting lectures. Very helpful during office hours and easy to talk to. Will help you with whatever he can in and out of the class. He is extremely knowledgable about everything China and gets students very involved in his lectures. You have to read everything he gives out or you'll be stuck in class. Highly recommended!,Minxin Pei ,Government department
 CHEM14,3.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Kojima's class is extremely difficult.  If you don't think you have a good understanding of chemistry prior to this class, don't even bother.  He uses an online homework system that is frustrating and very time consuming.",Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department
 ECON134CORPFIN,4.0,4.0,,,,No,"I like Binay. Helpful guy, and actually kept class interesting. One homework set per week (online, so you can't submit late, can take 30 minutes to like 3 hours, depending on the unit, so start early). Tests are tough, but reasonable. Your grade will reflect how much effort you want to put in, so if you work hard, the A is yours.",Murat Binay ,Economics department
 LIT70,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"a brilliant lecturer and a kind professor. picks excellent material. his Nabokov class is one of the best i've ever taken, and i recommend him highly to any student. he can be hard to track down/get a hold of and classes run late so be prepared for that.",Leland De La Durantaye ,Literature department
 FWS,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,No,bad instructor,Evan Kindley ,Literature department
 MATH30,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"I have a feeling people will give him a poor review this semester, but take those reviews with a grain of salt.  He's new and still learning how to teach.  But he's also brilliant and is VERY helpful in office hours.  Just beware of 8am maths at CMC.  The problem isn't the prof, but the students.  Krumm works very hard to teach this class.",David Krumm ,Mathematics department
 HIST125,5.0,2.0,,,A-,Yes,"SUCH A GREAT PROF!!! Everyone should take a class from this wonderful woman. The readings were light but super rewarding.

This is how college should be.",Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department

 CHEM14,4.5,2.0,,,B,No,"I really likes this professor. It's his first year teaching, so he still has to figure out what kind of teaching style is most effective for him. He tends to take things slowly, which can be detrimental if you already understand the material and just want to speed through, but it can also be a great thing when you don't understand a certain topic.",Benson Ngo ,Chemistry department
 BIOL171,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,No,Take his class. You won't regret it. He honestly wants you to do well and if you don't understand go to his office hours and he will make it simple to understand. He is by far one of the best prof. at keck.,Joseph Cohen ,Biology department

He spends a huge amount of time showing us trivial calculations (and confuses himself while doing so), but spends no time on the actually important concepts.

 ECON86,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"taylor may be ok for business law, but he is terrible for intro accounting. his teaching style is picking on individual students and asking them questions in front of the rest of the class. not only is that potentially embarrassing, but it doesn't help the student learn. they are scared to be called on. exams are very hard and the class is painful",James Taylor ,Accounting department
 GOV183,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,He's amazing!,George Thomas ,Government department

 ECON151,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"Flipped classroom was PHENOMENAL!  Much better than I imagined.  Yes, it was a bit annoying that videos were often posted late this first time around, but each time he invited students to request extra time if they needed it.  I asked for extension several times, and got no issues.  So did my friends.  So, he made accommodations for the lateness.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department
 ECON101,4.0,4.0,Yes,,,No,"While the pace of the class was quick, I began to appreciate Bjerk more and more throughout the semester. He is clear, nice, and engaging. When he strays away from the theory and computations and discusses practical stuff, the class becomes extremely interesting. The tests are hard to ace, but are fair and completely feasible. Take him for 101!",David Bjerk ,Economics department
 CHEM14,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Booooooo.  I did not like Fuculoro at all.  I could actually rant about this.  He might as well have openly told us that he didn't care about us learning at all.  Yes, it is easy...so take it if that is all you want. But if you want to actually learn, your wasting your time is his class.",Anthony Fucaloro ,Chemistry department
 RLST84,3.0,3.0,Yes,,,No,"Expect tons (200+ pages a week) of reading, very unclear grading, and inspirational-ish tangents. Content-based reading questions due every other week, threatens pop quizzes but never gives them. Asks you to buy tons of books, but you don't read all of them (especially if you only read every other week and fake it the off weeks)",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 PSY96,3.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,She is very condescending during office hours and unnecessarily blunt. She does not know how to encourage students to do better on assignments as she treats them like they are dumb or lost causes. She also has no filter and discusses your academics in front of other students. She also gets flustered before she's even asked you if you understand!,Catherine Reed ,Psychology department
 ECON50,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"An average professor. Midterms and finals are much harder than the book, and his lectures do not adequately prepare you for them. There is also a prevalent language barrier that makes him hard to understand. However, his grading isn't terrible. Don't expect to get a perfect A, but don't think you're in a world of hurt either if you end up with him.",Serkan Ozbeklik ,Economics department

 GOV20,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"I had Kesler for Gov 20 (Intro to American Politics) Fall '09. The class is pretty easy - just to do all the reading. There's a short paper (~2 pages), a longer paper (~5 pages), a midterm, and the final. Readings are tested on the exams. I would recommend going to class, though he can be pretty dry. I still learned a lot though! :)",Charles Kesler ,Government department
 MATH032,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"Taken CalculusII with professor Nelson, here's what I want to say: he is a pure mathematical genius and a CMC gem. As he says, there are 70% of Math that can be told easy way, but it is not yet told by other professors, and there is the rest 30% that is just plain hard. He makes concepts so simple, but efficient, and is always there to help. Take!",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 GOV113,2.0,3.0,,,,No,"Lectures during class, no need to pay attention or participate. Only assignments are two 20 page papers (but he actually wants 30+pgs- he cares about length and # of citations not quality) and 1 debate (on paper topic). No need to read, but helps with papers. Class could be much better, but hes an old guy stuck in his ways",Frederick Lynch ,Government department
 ECON050,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,"Prof Evans is AMAZING. ECON50 with her was always interesting and well structured. The class is very well organized and Prof Evans is quite accessible outside class.

 HIST159I,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Took her class completely on a whim because Islam/History has nothing to do with my major. I loved it! And I know that I loved it because she is so passionate about the subject matter which she teaches. She assigns a lot of reading but its worth it because the class is discussion based. She's a great professor and I highly recommend her,Heather Ferguson ,History department
 PHYS35,4.0,4.0,,,,,"He grades on his own curve.  Although it is discouraging to see such low scores on the test, it's ok because his grading scale is so wacked.  It's really not as bad as it seems, and the take home, open-everything, test is a plus.",Scot Gould ,Physics department
 BIO151,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Prof Ferree is dedicated to his work- which is so nice as a student. You have to work hard in his class for it to go smoothly- but he puts in a lot of hard work too. Class was interesting and interactive and although it was pretty tough, I really enjoyed it.",Patrick Ferree ,Biology department
 GOV020,5.0,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,Incredible professor -- ridiculously smart and hilarious too. Gives almost all the help you'd ever need on papers or preparing for tests if you go to his office.

 FHS10,4.5,3.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,I took Religion and Modernity FHS. Michon is a great professor that really cares about his students. Going to his office hours really helps because if you get to know him he will really help you out. Doesn't make you buy any textbooks which is really nice.

 ARBC001,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Great Professor! He is makes the language accessible by presenting culture as well as vocab and grammar. I def recommend this course to all CMCers! He is an amazing prof with tons of connections. He def knows how to take care of his students.,Bassam Frangieh ,Modern Languages department
 ECON50,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,Saman is the best econ teacher- she very clearly details exactly what will be on the exams. The only other grading criteria are quizzes. She tells you which questions from the book might be on them so you just have to make sure you know how to do those same exact problems (to get the answers you have to go to tutoring but there are only 6 or so).,Saman Olfati ,Economics department
 PHYS33,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,I did worse than I feel I should have considering I took two years pf physics in high school. Doesn't make intro physics very accessible and is unapproachable outside of class. There is tutoring which helps. Material overall wasn't covered very well in lecture and you basically have to study yourself using the book. Phys 34 is a way better class.,James Wells ,Physics department
 IBC040,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A+,No,"Professor Leconte is amazing! He is, hands down, one of the best professors I have ever had.

 FHS1,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Prof. Selig is an amazing professor! I had Gender and Society (FHS) with her as a freshman.

 PHIL30H,5.0,5.0,Yes,Yes,,No,Professor Kreines is awesome.

 ECON102,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,A,Yes,Ok professor. Moves kind of fasts in lectures and does not always explain concepts clearly. Tests include problem types never seen before. Office hours are not super helpful. Good news is he uploads PPTs so you can review.,Ricardo Fernholz ,Economics department

 GOVT020,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I loved this class with Dr. Muravchik.

 POSTWARUS,4.0,2.0,,,,,"Chucklin' Charlie we used to call him, due to the perpetual Burgess-Meredith-as-the-Penguin grin he always had. Dull but not unbearably so, affable and fair. Willing to help.

 LIT10,2.0,3.0,,,,,"This was a bad class. Prof. is very defensive and at times hostile, rejecting students ideas that don't line up w/ her own narrow, feminist, anti-male perspective. Grading policies are subjective and unfair. Don't touch w/ a ten-foot pole. (I want a refund.)",Audrey Bilger ,Literature department

 GOV125,3.5,3.0,,,,,"Very partisan.  Does not direct discussion but expects you to stay on her imaginary road map.  She will hold your political views/actions on group orientation against you.

She's an amazing Professor! I wish she was teaching 33 next semester!,Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department
 PSYCH110,4.5,1.0,,,,Yes,Gives students everything they could possibly need to get an A on the tests and gives soft deadlines for the long research paper so you can't procrastinate (super helpful). Tells us what we need to study and makes a spiral book for us to take notes in with notes already in it on each section. Really nice and doesn't mind giving lots of extra help.,Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department

 ECON50,1.5,3.0,,,,No,He tries to be funny but class is still very boring. He never answers questions in class and makes you feel bad if you have a question. You need to go to office hours to understand something more because class is not clear.

 PHIL090,1.5,1.0,,,,No,"Professor Gardiner is on a permanent acid trip. Take his class and find out why.

TAKE HIM",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department
 GOV142E,4.5,4.0,,,,No,An amazing professor - asks amazing questions and his lectures are super thought provoking.

Definitely take his class if you have the chance.,Minxin Pei ,Government department
 CHEM14,3.5,3.0,,,,No,It's true that he kind of expected you to know AP Chem material. He missed 7 days of class because his mother was sick so things were rushed. His exams are really difficult so there is usually a really big curve which benefits you if you do study. He's available and helpful with office hours and gives good advice for lab. But makes you think.,Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department

She makes sure you get the material so writing a paper is easier.,Tamara Venit-Shelton ,History department

He truly values the feedback and participation of his students.",Joseph Cohen ,Biology department
 CS55,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,No,Just avoid him. Lectures never make sense. Huge calculation on exams with unfair grading. He uses his body to cover the broad when he explains problems.

 BUSLAW,5.0,5.0,,,,,"Prof Taylor is the best prof CMC has to offer! He is to the point, and will not put up with BS.  He's invited students over for dinner and has made such an impact on my life.

That shouldn't be a problem in the future, however as the videos are made now.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department
 GOVT90,3.0,3.0,,,,,"While he was a good prof. and the class was worthwhile, I was a little bothered by the way he made his political views abundantly clear. His love of Scalia and the Right made the class less about education and more about indoctrination. He sometimes couldn't tell us the other point of view, which shouldn't be the case.",Ralph Rossum ,Government department
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Bjerk is extremely attentive, interested, and enthusiastic. He grades pretty difficultly and doesn't follow the textbook much at all, leaving lectures as the primary source for information, so you have to pay attention.

 CHEM014,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,Best Chemistry teacher i have ever had.  He is amazing and hysterical.  He tells you exactly what will be on the test  wants you to do well.  He sneaks funny side comments in what make the class entertaining.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND,Anthony Fucaloro ,Chemistry department
 RLST166B,2.0,4.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"Professor Espinosa is obviously intelligent but it he doesn't take the time to prep for his classes. We go over the same things- he shows the same videos, we have a poorly set up debate every class and we go over same questions. 300+ pages of reading weekly, bi-weekly 2 pg. papers (get same grade every time- 88). Flakes on office hours.",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 PSY96,3.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"It's true, she did speak in a way that insults students' intelligence, which made class very boring. Some assignments seemed like busy-work, and she does read off of her slides for ""lecture"". Her perkiness was also very annoying. However, the class isn't really too hard. Test questions are usually worded the exact same way her slides are.",Catherine Reed ,Psychology department

 ECON101,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Lincoln is a brilliant professor. He is a really smart man.

He is great at both explaining the intuition and mathematics behind economics. Take his class.",William Lincoln ,Economics department
 GOV20,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"He's harder for some easier for others, but overall I think he's reasonable. Sometimes lectures get boring. this isn't really a discussion class.

If y",Charles Kesler ,Government department
 MATH060,5.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"Relatively innovative but chill grading system; no need to buy textbook; need to pay close attention to his lectures or you will find it hard to understand what's going on.

He is really cool.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 GOVT113,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"He's a really accomplished figure in the political commentary world- multiple published books and appearances on TV shows. He will remind you of that a lot! But yes, listening to him lecture for 3 hours gets tedious, and the 20 page papers are daunting. The whole class is centered around 2 papers and a debate, and there's not too much participation",Frederick Lynch ,Government department
 ECON050,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"A lecture heavy course, but I think all Econ 50 courses are. I would say she is right down the middle in terms of difficulty. She teaches the material pretty well, and you will learn all the things you need to know out of Econ 50. Homework assignments are easy and a good chunk of your grade. Not an easy A, but not extremely difficul to  either.",Mary Evans ,Economics department
 BIO151,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Ferree is so interested in making sure that his students are enjoying the class and understanding the material.

Highly recommend!",Daniel Michon ,Religion & Philosophy department
 GOV060,5.0,4.0,,,,,"Probably the best lectures i've had on campus. She is incredibly sharp and on-point for every single class and doesn't waste student's time.

 PHYS33,2.5,3.0,,,,,Prof. Naftilan = a mass of negative energy,Steve Naftilan ,Physics department
 MATH151,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"Very clear lectures. Problem solving and technique focus rather than theory focus- he often glosses or omits proofs of the algorithms he teaches you. This prepares students well for the actuarial exams or other tests, but those looking for purer math might want more. Never uses the text book.",Mark Huber ,Mathematics department
 FWS10,1.5,4.0,Yes,,A,No,"Prof Morrison is one of the worst professors I have ever taken at CMC. His lectures are brutally boring and he talks too much. I didn't learn anything new from his FWS class. Although I did comparatively well in the class, his grading standards are absurd and you don't know why you diddidn't do well. Avoid at all cost.",James Morrison ,Literature department
 ECON050,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,Yes,Very interesting class from which I learned a lot especially because I didn't have an Econ background. Olfati is funny and makes the material as interesting as possible but it is Econ and you can expect a few long boring problem sets in lectures.

 PHYS30,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Landsberg is hilarious in that he is so painfully organized.  He really knows what he's teaching and is very clear in explanations.  He gives you print outs of all of his powerpoint lectures, which was a plus.  No need for book reading here!  Problem sets are a pain, but overall it could have been much worse. He's easily the best choice for phyics.",Adam Landsberg ,Physics department
 ECON180,4.5,2.0,,,,No,"econ 180 is the seminar that goes with thesis. burdekin is the nicest guy in the world, and he's always willing to help. a lot of professors at cmc make you see them in person before they'll be helpful at all, but burdekin reads through e-mails and replies thoroughly. that's amazingly convenient and it shows how much he cares about his students!",Richard Burdekin ,Economics department

Sometimes, he isn't good at managing class time though.",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department
 FWS10,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"A very nice woman who's class was interesting at times, but was often dull. Her grading is harsh and wants her writing in a specific style.

 ECON50,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A-,No,"For a lecture-type class, there was lots of class discussion and he made the material seem really easy.

He's super nice and the midterms and finals are exactly like the homework assignments.",Ricardo Fernholz ,Economics department
 PHIL038,1.0,5.0,Yes,,A-,No,"I learned nothing in his class. Throughout, Locke was extremely unhelpful and seemed determined to make it as hard as possible for his students to do well. I have not yet encountered a worse professor, and I don't think I will.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department

 SPAN044,3.0,1.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Professor Gonzales, while unclear on expectations from time to time, truly cares about his students and their success.

 LIT130,4.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,Not a bad professor. Has a little quirk and quiet demeanor to him. Likes smart students that participate with smart comments.

Unfortunate, considering that the other section of this class is taught by a nut.",Mark Blitz ,Government department

 CALC2,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,Drop/Withdrawal,Yes,"I withdrew from the class after the second midterm and have never been so relieved.

 ECON50,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Awesome prof. Gives out homework and short essays, but you get a 100 on them. Tests are difficult, but he gives out study guides and the homework usually makes up for a less then amazing test score.",Meric Keskinel ,Economics department
 GOV80,4.0,3.0,,,A,,"Nichols may be a goofy bald man, but between the giggles and the chin rubbing, this might have been the most i've learned in any class.  interesting stuff too.",James Nichols ,Government department
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"He is great- doesn't assign too much work, but demands your full attention in class, which if you give him, will help a lot with tests. Plus his deviations and anecdotes during class are good times to catch up on the content and polish your notes. Very logical, no fluff, no spoon feeding, and a great professor!",Colin Wright ,Economics department
 LIT10,4.5,3.0,,,,,Don't get on her bad side but she's very clear as to what is and isn't acceptable.  If you participate in class then you are golden.,Ann Meyer ,Literature department

 PHILOSOPHY,1.5,5.0,,,,,Uses subjective nature of material to assign arbitrary and nonsensical marks.,Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department
 MATH31,4.5,4.0,,,,,"Professor Martelli is absolutely awesome!! Although at times I sat in class confused about the topic, he is willing to help you until you understand during his office hours. As long as you go in for help when you need it, it is very possible to get an A in his class.",Mario Martelli ,Mathematics department
 PYSCHSECT,1.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"One of the worst professors I've ever taken. Rude, not interest in students or their learning. If she doesn't like you, she will make your life hell--and she doesnt seem to like anyone. Made fun of an Asian kid in the class for squinting more than one time. Totally nuts.",Marjorie Charlop-Christy ,Psychology department
 HIST126,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Lectures are dry, but much easier to follow if you have done the reading. He went out of his way to help me complete the class after problems in my other courses put me way behind.",Charles Lofgren ,Political Science department
 CHEM116AND15,4.5,2.0,,,,,"His teaching style suited me perfectly for ochem but, when I had him during his one semester of teaching gen chem, it didn't transition over very well. He takes a more problem-based approach and, refreshingly, doesn't lecture at you. If you have to take ochem, take Black. Decent lab prof too.",Kersey Black ,Chemistry department
 ECON175,4.0,1.0,,,,,She's funny in a Canadian sort of way. Work load is pretty light.,Heather Antecol ,Economics department
 GOV70,3.5,3.0,,,,No,There is no way Haley earned the reputation he has now by teaching this way. I really like him as a person but every day he shows up to class and talks about whatever he feels like talking about that day.  Its a waste of time to even sit through his lectures I would only recommend him for help outside of class,Edward Haley ,Government department
 CALC1,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"easy class. assigns HW and never checks it. lets you use a notecard on tests and gives practice tests that are 90% identical to the actual exam. extremely boring as a teacher. if you dont mind studying the material yourself, and going to office hours for additional help, you will A+ this class. super nice professor. recommend this class highly!",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,5.0,3.0,,,,,very clear and incredibly funny.  i would recommend him if you want a straightforward econ 50 experience.  i also think he's a pretty nice guy.  just follow his system and you'll be fine.,Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department
 LIT010,1.5,3.0,,,,,Terrible teacher.  Teacher lets feminist ideologies get in the way of teaching.  She plays favorites and will not allow contradictions to her own ideas.  She will actually grade people down for stating contradicting opinions during class.  She's an easy te,Audrey Bilger ,Literature department
 CALCULUS30,5.0,1.0,,,,,Good man with reasonable expectations. He was the best for calculus all things considered.,James Pinter-Lucke ,Mathematics department
 GANDHIANDMAO,4.5,2.0,,,,,"The Baum is The Bomb.  Gandhi and Mao should really be called Gandhi and/or Mao though.  Class was long, but he is a nice grader, and a nice guy.  It's a lot of reading and writing, but he will reward you with a good grade.",Arthur Rosenbaum ,History department
 INTROACCOUNTING,1.0,4.0,,,,,"Introduction to Accounting really isn't all that hard. Somewhere between the lame jokes, the disorganized notes and the ""tricky"" MC questions this course became torture!",Joshua Rosett ,Economics department
 MATH030,2.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"While she may be helpful and willing to answer questions, she wouldn't have to if she explained the material fully before assinging homework. She does a very poor job with in class explanations and examples. She also gives very, very, long, difficult homework assignments that do not reflect what we learned in class. In my opinion, an awful prof.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department

 PSYCH109,4.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"He uses a textbook that is easy to comprehend, gives handouts of his powerpoints (what his class lectures are based on), and makes a book outlining everything he teaches with spaces to take notes. He tells you exactly what you need to know for every test so it's super easy to get an A.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department

 SPAN44,4.5,1.0,,,,No,Profesora Martinez is one of the best teachers that I have ever had the opportunity to learn from. Her classes are so much fun and we talk about the most random topics. She's flexible with assignments and tests and there is not a lot of busywork.,Maria Martinez ,Modern Languages department
 ECON50,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Hilarious British Professor. If you really pay attention this man is hilarious. Great for a GE. Don't but the newest version of the book, the versions haven't changed very much at all.

 CS51,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Exactly what the person beneath me said.,Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department
 HIST101,1.0,1.0,,,,No,Incredibly boring. Acts like she's falling asleep. Seems stoned. But her class is super easy. Easiest A at CMC.,Nita Kumar ,History department
 ECON50,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Really nice. Fair. But you can tell she is a new teacher. She specializes in micro, so when she started teaching macro, she had no idea what she was explaining and just gave out formulas. But she's nice and funny.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department
 ECON102,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Super responsible, very helpful in and after class, charming.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department
 CHEM14,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"This man was a visiting professor to this school. He is from UCLA and I will greatly appreciate it if he gets sent back there! He CAN NOT teach. His lectures are ALL powerpoint based, very minimal board work. He speeds through sections and expects you to know AP Chem material. He himself has attendance issues and tests are VERY hard. DO NOT TAKE!",Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department
 FWS,4.0,1.0,Yes,,A+,Yes,"His class is very easy and we cover interesting material. He has a pretty laid back and does not lecture. You have to go to class willing to participate, which isn't hard because he has you read passages from the book then discuss it in class. Don't buy the text books, get them from the library andor share.",Evan Kindley ,Literature department
 BIO43L,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"I just had him for lab and he gave very detailed lectures at the beginning of each lab (which would make lab take a long time). He cares a lot about his students though, and as long as you are trying and ask for help, you'll do  really well.",Joseph Cohen ,Biology department
 CSCI055,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,,No,"Shaar is a nice guy, but he's not particularly good at explaining things and sometimes blames the class when his students don't understand the lecture. He also takes huge amounts off points of for small errors on tests. His class is frustrating, and I would not be surviving it if I didn't have a strong study group to work with.",Ahmad Shaar ,Computer Science department
 BUSINESSLAW,5.0,1.0,,,,,"If you are intelligent, have a strong work ethic, and don't mind standing up for yourself then this is one of the better teachers you can have.  Otherwise you will just think this guy is an ass.  I thought he was one of the best profs at CMC, despite the W",James Taylor ,Accounting department
 GOVT91,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"One of the best professors at CMC. The class is definitely not easy (especially the papers), but it's always interesting. Very discussion-oriented during class. For both 90 & 91, we had three 7-10 page papers & a final exam. If you're interested in Con Law, definitely take a Thomas class.",George Thomas ,Government department
 HIST097,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Great professor, really engaging. He is very passionate and knowledgeable on the subject matter - this class was called ""Researching the Holocaust"" and I learned a lot. He is also very accommodating in terms of the workload, although he assigns a lot of reading. I would definitely recommend him though.",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department
 ECON151,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"This prof is quite the badass: extremely clear, friendly, and energetic. Class is much more interesting than the typical Econ class, and flipped classroom was much better than you'd think. His tests are brutally straightforward if you study - no surprises (some of the questions were much, much easier than what you do in class). Recommend  100%",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department
 GOV90,3.5,4.0,,,,,"Rossum is a great lecturer and you know the Supreme Court cases well but there isnt much discussion.  Also, he is a bit hard of a grader and takes seemingly random points on midterms, but the quality of work and reading is not too demanding.",Ralph Rossum ,Government department
 ECON101,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Professor Bjerk is probably one of the best professors I've had at CMC. I went into this class knowing NOTHING about econ (I didn't learn anything in econ 50), but Bjerk taught concepts from the basics. He's clear and effective. If you do the weekly homework (4ish easy problems), online readings, and actually study for midterms, you can get an A.",David Bjerk ,Economics department
 CHEM15,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"What can I say, the man is a legend. He answers his cell phone in class, that's how dedicated he is to his students. A true modern renaissance man with an old Italian charm.",Anthony Fucaloro ,Chemistry department
 RLST166B,2.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Great readings - do them on your own. Awful teacher. Pointless essays answering 10 to 20 specific, content-oriented, non-analytical questions on the reading. Class spent answering questions that you JUST did for your essay. Changingambivalent final paper expectations. Pretentious professor. No true academic dialogue - you're expected to conform. ",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 INTROPSYCH,2.5,1.0,,,,No,"If you're looking to get an easy A GE out of the way, intro psych with reed is the way to go. The class is really easy, but she is an awful teacher that teaches down the material so much so that going to her class is an annoyance. She means well, but her class is a glorified daycare full of powerpoint heavy lecture and condescendingly slow pacing.",Catherine Reed ,Psychology department
 ECON125,3.0,3.0,,,,No,"It was his first time teaching the class, and he definitely tried to make it as good as possible. He was accommodating and nice, the class is just incredibly hard.",Serkan Ozbeklik ,Economics department
 ECON101,5.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,He is an adorable professor. Very clear and straight forward. Curves his class and you are most likely to get an A if you follow his instructions and understand the practice problems. He is very intelligent and always willing to help. He holds tons of office hours and is pretty chill. Take him for Micro and you won't regret it even once.,William Lincoln ,Economics department
 GOV20,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"reasonable amount of reading and somewhat interesting class dicussions. grade is based on a midterm, paper, and final, limiting how well (and how poorly) you can do in the course. almost every student earns a B. kesler is a genius, yet his lectures are often dry and boring. he's a really nice guy though.",Charles Kesler ,Government department
 CALC32,3.0,2.0,Yes,,A,No,"I was a little thrown off at the beginning with the notation and proof-heavy questions, but it is honestly standard practice in math at the 5Cs. Professor Nelson has probably the most favorable grading system I have ever had, and was generally very clear in his lectures. His sense of humor is subtle and he's quiet, so try to sit close to the front.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 GOV105,2.5,3.0,,,,No,"I've heard from some of the other students that they love the class, but I feel very differently. Professor can be very funny and interesting at times... but hearing him talk for 3 hours gets dull. Or even worse, him talking for 1 hour and then putting on a video with a ""guest speaker"" for the rest of class. I can watch CSPAN in my dorm room!",Frederick Lynch ,Government department
 ECON171,3.0,3.0,Yes,,A,No,Evan's Environmental Econ class is more economic math and theory based that I would have initially thought. Be prepared to use a good deal of micro and do homeworks that are fairly challenging. There are assigned readings but if you can BS the participation on them you should be okay. Tests aren't particularly hard but aren't easy.,Mary Evans ,Economics department
 BIO43,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Lectures are dry, you need to read the textbook for the tests, but he takes attendance. Tests are very detail oriented. Not very helpful in office hours, but he is a nice guy. Not recommended.",Patrick Ferree ,Biology department

 FHS10,4.5,2.0,Yes,,A-,No,"Though not as prominent academically as some other religious studies teachers at CMC, Michon's passion and knowledge of the coursework made every class interesting and engaging.

 GOV6070,4.5,4.0,,,,,"Great prof, knowledgeable, helpful, reasonable workload but fairly high expectations.",Hilary Appel ,Government department
 GOV1,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,A good teacher but he oozes grad school smugness and arrogance. Wants you to learn the material and is helpful but is inconsistent with grading papers. Not a bad intro class if you're reasonably intelligent,Zachary Courser ,Government department
 MATH32H,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"HUBER IS AMAZING. LOVE THIS MAN. Incredibly helpful and approachable at office hours - take advantage of it for homework. Super smart, will explain things until you get it, the tests are very manageable - he lets you bring in equation/example sheets. He also adds a very generous curve at the end. Favorite class this semester - Huber is the best!!!",Mark Huber ,Mathematics department
 FWS10,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"FWS 10: Literature and Film:I loved this class! The course material was super interesting--we got to see and write essays on the Shawshank Redemption, and if you follow his guidelines, you will DEFINITELY GET AN A! Im not a lit major, but I am taking another class with him some time soon!",James Morrison ,Literature department
 ECON050,4.5,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Professor Olfati is a great professor and person! She is extremely helpful and taught the subject very thoroughly. Going in, I had no prior background in economics, but she really gave me a great overview. I got an A, but was on top of all the assignments, read ahead, and went to office hours. The midterms and final are a HUGE part of the grade.",Saman Olfati ,Economics department
 PHYS33,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Passionate about physics? Like having a high GPA? ... prepare to have that ruined if you take a class with Wells. I learned more in tutoring then in class, office hours were very unhelpful. Professor Wells taught me less then the textbook. Constantly acted like he wasn't passionate about his teaching or his students .",James Wells ,Physics department
 IBC40,3.0,5.0,Yes,,,No,"He's a smart guy but tests are insanely hard. Goes pretty fast during lectures making it hard to keep up. Sometimes makes you feel a little out of place when asking a question, but overall very helpful if you ask in recitation/office hours. Problem sets are a nightmare.",Aaron Leconte ,Chemistry department
 HIST101,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"It's been over ten years since I had my first class with Professor Selig, but it changed my life. It was called ""Currents of Reform"" and was offered as an honors history class for freshmen in the fall of 2001. Amazing class, and Professor Selig's passion for the subject couldn't help but sweep us up as well.",Diana Selig ,History department
 ECON102,4.0,3.0,,,,No,"Burdekin is a decent teacher and a nice guy. his class is a little dry, but there is minimal hw and the tests are graded on a giant curve. that being said, people will literally fail his class, but if you study hard for just 2 exams and a final, you'll do well. I would recommend him, but i would not discourage someone from taking a different class.",Richard Burdekin ,Economics department
 ECON,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,boring ....hard to understand....circular in his explanations...,Yaron Raviv ,Economics department
 GOVT060,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"I definitely recommend taking Aseema's GOVT060 class! She is a sweet and bright lady. She is always willing to help and she never forces you to participate in class, though she has room for class participation (i.e. its not all lecture). Her tests are not hard - she focuses on important concepts not trivial details.",Aseema Sinha ,Government department
 HIST104,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"The class was really interesting even though it was subject matter I'd never been interested in before. Assigns a LOT of reading, but you can probably get away with skimming it since he mostly focuses on the big picture. Be warned, procrastinating in this class can be dangerous - the final paper is due the same day as the final.",shane Bjornlie ,History department
 PHIL34,5.0,2.0,,,,No,Best professor at CMC. Super funny. Keeps class really interesting. The subject matter is great. He's reasonable and assigns the perfect amount of reading. Best feedback on papers I've ever received. Made me consider majoring in philosophy. People say he can be a bit condescending but he really isn't. Take his class!!!! You won't regret it.,Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department
 GOVT70,2.5,3.0,,,,No,"I didn't like this class: grading on papers was very arbitrary and it is true- she doesn't like to admit when she is wrong and she can be very condescending at times, forgetting to be constructively critical.",Jennifer Taw ,Government department
 FWS010,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Professor Lobis is a very helpful professor. He responds to emails very promptly. His class can be kind of boring but his friendliness makes up for it. He isn't too difficult of a grader. I would definitely take another class from him.,Seth Lobis ,Literature department
 FWS010,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,Not sure yet,Yes,"Professor Warner will make you a good writer. His grading is tough and he will notice the smallest of mistakes, but it's to help you improve your writing.

This class will change your life, and Professor O is brilliant.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 FHS01,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Kreines is a good professor but not 10/10(!!!!!!!!).  Discussions are good & well-led.  Office hours can be a little confusing.  His brain moves much faster than most, so it can be hard to follow what he's saying in office hours.",James Kreines ,Philosophy department
 ECON50,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,One of the best professors at CMC! He is one of the most clear lecturers and relays the information very thoroughly. Easily accessible outside of class through office hours and emails. Each test and quiz are fair to the content.,Ricardo Fernholz ,Economics department
 PHIL038,2.5,2.0,Yes,,,No,This class is to philosophy what some kids talking about reality after watching Interstellar is to Immanuel Kant. Take this class if you heard the word philosophy somewhere but have no idea what it means and want to learn more.

 GOV117,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"If you're interested at all in California Politics, take the class it's totally worth it. Even if you're not sure you're that interested, it's a great class.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",Ken Miller ,Government department

 FWS010,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"I am a international student and a freshman. I definitely recommend his class. He knows how to teach and how to teach wisely about writing.

Take his class and You will be amazed by literature!!!",Thomas Schur ,Literature department
 RLST055,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"His lectures are really dense but well organizedGilbert makes it easy to learn a lot. A decent amount of writing plus mandatory field trip to a museum. I honestly wasn't that interested in the subject matter, but now I'm really glad I took the class bc I learned so much. Wish I had taken more cool random classes like this during my four years.",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department
 GOV80,3.5,1.0,,,,,"Long, droning lectures are a bit difficult to get through, but you have GOT to go to class to do well in this class. The testing method - identifying and explaining passages - is a little weird and gets REALLY hard on the final, when you have 7 or 8 authors to choose from. Still, learned a lot and he will help you out if you ask for it.",Mark Blitz ,Government department

 CHEM116,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Wonderful professor.  Very clear in what she says in class, and very importantly, the tests were relatively fair.  If you study and understand her handouts, your classnotes, do her assigned problems, study her help session problems, and practice test sets, you should be fine in her class.  She is also open to answering questions if you need it.",Anna Wenzel ,Chemistry department
 ECON86,4.5,5.0,,,,No,"He cares more about his students and making sure we actually LEARN the material than any other teacher I can imagine. He puts in so much work to help us, that said he expects us to do the same. If you don't work hard, you WON'T do well in this class.

 HIST080,2.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Early U.S. History.  I did well in A.P. U.S. History in high school, but this guy is a hard grader.  He knows everything about anything he brings up in class.  He expects you to, also.",Charles Lofgren ,Political Science department
 CHEM116,5.0,2.0,,,,,"Dr. Black is AWESOME, take him if you can.",Kersey Black ,Chemistry department
 GOV70,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Very occasionally, you'll see flashes of brilliance.  The rest of the time, it's clear he's begun a downward spiral.  His lectures are abysmal.  Most of the time, he merely rants about Iraq, or some other hot-button issue.  The assignments are insultingly childish.  The only redeeming factor is his book selection, which was sporadically rewarding.",Edward Haley ,Government department
 MATH32,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,This professor gets a bad rep of being boring and difficult. From my experience he was not the most interesting professor but he was nice and very fair with grading. He is always in his office to help you and lets you use a note card on all tests. He is great. Easy and taught me the material.,Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,1.5,4.0,,,,,"def a dork, hard tests, does not grade easy, doesn't clarify the answer when you ask a question, will not help out when you have trouble, or had trouble, with a concept. make sure you label ALL CHARTS!!! marks off random point values.",Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department
 FEMINISTTHEORY,5.0,4.0,,,,,"She has one of the largest cult followings at CMC. She's a hard grader. Her office hours are jampacked.  That said, she's incredibly, incredibly nice and down to earth. Go chat with her just for fun (if there's not a huge line).",Audrey Bilger ,Literature department
 MATH030,2.5,2.0,,,,,"Pinter-Lucke is the man, there are maybe ten problems due per week. 3 tests total, and they're pretty basic, straight-forward. He's pretty unorganized though, he sometimes loses himself in his lectures",James Pinter-Lucke ,Mathematics department
 GANDHIANDMAO,5.0,4.0,,,B,,"A lot of work, but if you do it expect the grades to be good.  Nice guy too.  He keeps the class interesting, challenging, but he's also understanding if you make minor screw-ups every once and a while.",Arthur Rosenbaum ,History department
 ECON86,1.5,4.0,,,,,"You'd think that grades in accounting would be clear but his grading is shiftier than a manual transmission car because he curves to a murky ""historical"" class average.

 DCPROGRAM,1.0,5.0,,,,,"Quite possibly one of the worst professors. Arrogant, rude, neo-con. She does not care about her students and lets all her coservative views come through in her discussions and in grading you. She is just awful, and unwilling to help with any misunderstandings. Insecure, Condescending. Don't take he",Elizabeth Spalding ,Government department
 BIOLOGY44,1.0,3.0,,,,,"DO NOT TAKE. I MEAN IT. Do not take biology with this lady. You will learn nothing. She knows her shtuff, it is obvious, but doesn't speak clear English. Her class is poorly organized. Just reconsider. Try Sadava or something.",Irene Tang ,Biology department
 LIT10,4.5,2.0,,,,,"A really nice guy and a fairly easy teacher, but not terribly easy.  His ease comes from the fact that he doesn't assign much work.  We had four papers in the semester.  He does grade a bit toughly, though, so if you don't want to do much but don't mind a B, he's a good prof.",Adam Bradley ,Literature department

 FREN044,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"I absolutely loved taking French with Professor Aitel. She is funny, nice, understanding, and easy. She is so good that I took 33 and 44 with her. I highly recommend taking a class from her!",Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department
 PSYCH109,2.0,4.0,,,,No,"Cook is a really nice guy and extremely willing to help. However, I would definitely NOT recommend him for Stats. He is very unclear in class, and will confuse you even more if you ask him a question. He is slightly condescending, and does not agree with info in the book. This means that if you plan to learn from the book, don't expect a good grade",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 RLSTSECT,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Lejon is one of the best professors I have ever had. I don't know what these guys are talking about.

 CS133,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"This teacher is thoroughly boring and misleading. If here were more comprehensible students may notice more of the continuous mistakes he makes is speaking and diagrams. Just get his power point slides and read the book, he is completely useless.",Arthur Lee ,Computer Science department
 FHS10,2.5,2.0,,,,No,"Prof is up to a lot of great things. Unfortunately, she's not the greatest prof, IMHO. Lectures were somewhat confusing. She asks a lot of questions (to get us to think), but somehow there was a barrier we couldn't bridge. Class was based on readings (which we discussed), several short papers, and a presentation - no exams or a final! Overall, ok.",Nita Kumar ,History department
 ECON50,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"By far the worst class I've taken at the Claremont colleges. She couldn't teach a 5 year old how to read. Midterms are difficult, you can get screwed over even if you study. I went to her office hours for clarity, but she's unhelpful. I'm usually an A- student but I struggled to get a C- in this class. Not recommended.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department
 ECON102,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Best professor I have ever had in my life. I would take any class with Shelton even if it were named ""2 hours of Prof. Shelton sharing his wisdom."" If u take his class you will have to try relatively hard but its more than worth it.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department
 CHEM15,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"He is a VERY difficult professor. A nice and occasionally funny guy, and you certainly learn a lot in his class. However, he has mini 'quizzes' every day in class and his tests usually have an average of around 70% or lower. Once, it was a 30%. Still, if you are looking to become proficient in chemistry, he's your man.",Robert Kojima ,Chemistry department
 FWS,4.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Professor Kindley is awesome! He was always available for papers and chose novels that were actually interesting. If you are like me and you hate reading, this class will make you think twice. I am now more inspired to read. He grades fairly so just read, participate, and go to the writing center. Best class ever!",Evan Kindley ,Literature department

 BEGFINACTG,1.0,3.0,,,,,Poor teaching skills. Talks about his tax life too much. Talks about irrelavant Wall Street Journal at the beginning of each class. Poor grading method for final project.

 ECON151,4.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B,No,"You don't have much choice for professors if you have to take this class, and there are very few people who take this subject for fun. The class is hard but if you really apply yourself you should be fine. The flipped classroom helps a lot because it makes you study the material over and over again. Study hard for the midterms, they're brutal.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department
 GOV90,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Smart, smart guy. ""Fair"" grader. I probably would have learned a lot more in his class if I did any of the reading, but it was still really interesting. Boring lectures, but once in a while he'll slip in a joke that is hilarious if you can catch it -- most people don't.",Ralph Rossum ,Government department
 ECON101,4.0,4.0,,,,No,"Professor Bjerk is a nice guy. Always teaches with Powerpoint slides. There is a lot of information, so don't plan on missing class.

Be prepared to study hard before tests.",David Bjerk ,Economics department
 CHEM15L,4.0,1.0,,,,No,"I took Fuc second semester and it was not only much more interesting than Zanella's class, but much easier. He gives you templates for exactly how to solve problems - unless you're a lazy ass - you should be acing his tests. Doesn't take attendance, but if you don't go, youll miss the answers. Honestly, didn't pick up my text book more than 5 times",Anthony Fucaloro ,Chemistry department
 FHS010,4.0,4.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"Prof. Espinosa is very knowledgable and sophisticated. He assignes more readings and papers than average, but he also gives very detailed feedbacks. He corrects all the papers very thoroughly and I feel like I come out of this class a better writer. He is a tough grader, rarely gives out A or A-, mostly B+.",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 PSYCH30,2.0,3.0,,,,No,"She is incredibly boring.  Professor Reed is obviously interested in the material but she just lacks the ability to teach.  Way too powerpoint heavy, I find myself copying down her powerpoints verbatim.

 ECON101,5.0,1.0,Yes,,A,No,Professor Lincoln is a legend and a half. He makes Micro so straight forward and is very clear about what is expected of you on tests. There are occassional problem sets that are helpful. 10/10 would recommend.,William Lincoln ,Economics department

 MATH31,2.0,3.0,Yes,,B,No,DO NOT TAKE CALC 2 UNLESS YOU HAVE TO. One of the hardest classes at CMC. His quizzes are pretty easy. If you have not taken AP Calc BC expect to work your butt off. Both midterms were fair. The concepts on the final were fair but he made it unnecessarily hard. Do not buy textbook (you will never use it).,Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 GOV105,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Prof Lynch is a baller! Class is really interesting, but the papers are killer. If you put in the time, though, you should do fine. Don't take this class if you procrastinate unless you are really good at cranking out 20 pagers.",Frederick Lynch ,Government department

 GOV128C,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"This is my second class with Areshedze. Very insightful lecturer, passionate about politics, young and energetic. During class he offers brilliant insight to the readings.

Love his class",Giorgi Areshidze ,Government department
 RLST010,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Best professor at the claremont colleges! Taught me more about a subject that I could have ever imagined. His class is organized perfectly and his lectures come together and connect in the most amazing way. Super passionate about what he teaches, and the class is very reasonable: substantial work, and if you do it well you'll get a good grade",Daniel Michon ,Religion & Philosophy department
 GOV20,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"very knowledgeable. he assigns a lot of reading and he relies greatly on class participation, but will rarely call on students who don't volunteer. he may seem pompous at first, but warms-up through the semester. overall, if you pay attention you'll learn a lot.",Zachary Courser ,Government department
 MATH151,5.0,3.0,,,,No,Great professor. Lectures are interesting and concepts explained well. Problem sets are difficult but he will walk you through every problem in office hours. One of the best Professors I've had at CMC,Mark Huber ,Mathematics department

 ECON50,3.5,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Didn't take her own subject too seriously, made the workload easy to handle, gave quizzes instead of homework, very clear about what was expected, tests were fair, she's quite funny during lecture. Doesn't really inspire you to want to take econ unless you're already headed that way, so good for STEM majors just looking to fulfil a GE.",Saman Olfati ,Economics department
 PHYS033L,1.0,4.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"He made the class more difficult than it's supposed to be. Your grade for the class is basically your overall grade from midterms/final. Homework and quizzes and labs don't really matter. Not helpful during office hours. A ton of work is assigned, not helpful though. Rip 3-2.",James Wells ,Physics department
 1IBC,4.0,5.0,Yes,,B-,Yes,"Helpful, but one of the hardest classes I've ever taken and assigns ridiculous amounts of work.",Aaron Leconte ,Chemistry department
 H175,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"One of the nicest, most caring, and passionate teachers on campus! I wish I had known about her sooner. She provides lots of flexibility with assignments to ensure you are able to write about topics that interest you. Very discussion based class style. If you're interested in the content of the courses she teaches, take them!",Diana Selig ,History department
 ECON135,4.5,3.0,,,,No,Professor Burdekin is a very intelligent and articulate teacher.  If you do not pay attention in class your notes are meaningless once you get around to them.  His tests are challenging but everything is very straight forward.  The presentation is kind of a joke and putting in the time generally results in a good score.,Richard Burdekin ,Economics department
 PSYC30,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"I really liked her teaching style. She used a powerpoint, but was very energetic and added to it a lot. You should read the book. She covers a lot, but definitely not all test material in lecture. I had trouble getting the essays to the required length, though they were only 4-5 pgs. Sometimes it felt like the length didn't fit the style she wanted",Tomoe Kanaya ,Psychology department
 ECON129,1.5,4.0,,,,Yes,Very hard to understand because of his thick accent. But if you have no choice but to take his class what can you do.,Yaron Raviv ,Economics department
 HIST166B,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"This professor works hard to teach great history.  One of the best lecturers around, every class day is like listening to a story.  The reading is pretty challenging, but he understands if you need an extension and will write rec letters as needed.  Great professor overall!!",shane Bjornlie ,History department
 PRINCOFPHIL,3.5,4.0,,,,No,I actually really liked this class and I think he genuinely made me a smarter person. The workload isn't bad- you write a one page paper each class but it's usually just a reflection and he doesn't want you to take more than 30 mins on it. Plus 3-4 major papers. Taught me a lot. And go to class to discuss or else you won't get participation points!,Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department
 GOV70,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Taw is one of my favorite profs ever. She is extremely knowledgeable and loves what she does. Our group discussions were great. Reading is necessary but not too long. Highly recommended prof.,Jennifer Taw ,Government department

 FWS1,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"He goes out of his way to make the subject interesting and make himself available outside of class. You really have to work for an A, but when you do, you learn a lot. He'll make you a better reader/writer. His feedback is sometimes longer than your entire essay, and it's because he truly cares about helping his students learn.",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department
 LIT063,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Chaucer. Took for a GE and it was actually a very enjoyable class. Loved Professor Rentz. She was a total sweetheart and was very helpful in office hours. Only two papers 5-7 pages, homework, and a research guide made up the grade. Not a whole lot of reading but that was counterbalanced by the fact it was all in middle english.",Ellen Rentz ,Literature department
 SPAN44,2.5,2.0,,,,,"Unhelpful and has a draconian attendance policy. His class is easy, I got an A without showing up much BUT then he knocked off a grade point for every absence after 3... I only passed because the language assistant was my friend and pulled hard for me.",Salvador Velazco ,Modern Languages department
 FHS10,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"VERY Strict about attendence!  If you want a slacker class, this is not it.  The reading isn't too bad, but she challenges you to extrapolate farther than every expected, with a reading paper required for almost every class.  Prof. O keeps it dynamic in the classroom, too, with some of the best discussions I have ever had in my academic life.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 PHIL90H,3.5,2.0,,,,,"She doesn't care what you think.  She just wants you to agree with her.  This goes for class discussion and papers and it is ****ing annoying.  The point of the class in her mind is to teach you how to arrive at the correct conclusions, which she determines.  Not the point of philosophy in my book.  It's fine if you don't mind pandering to the her",Amy Kind ,Philosophy department
 PHIL127,4.0,4.0,Yes,,A,No,"He has high expectations for your work, but is more than willing to help you get there. He is super passionate about what he's teaching, and clearly brilliant.

 ECON50,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Fernholz is a very clear and reasonable professor. His lectures are always neat, detailed, and available for us. No mandatory reading, 4 homework assignments, a few small reading assignments, 3 quizzes, 2 midterms, and a final exam. He curves heavily on the people at the bottom and lightly on the people up top. Work hard, and you can earn an A.",Ricardo Fernholz ,Economics department
 PHIL38,4.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Very fun class atmosphere. Lively discussion. Locke is very unique, as you will learn. He has a unique system for papers that I liked. He is a big fan of short papers.

Really learned how to write thanks to him! Sometimes he babies us a bit, but all in all LOVE.",John J. Pitney ,Government department
 MATH60,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Professor Aksoy's Linear Algebra can be challenging but she makes her available for office hours and is extremely clear in her lecture. She is very humorous and friendly around campus. One of the best math professors I have had!,Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department

 SPAN125,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"There's a fine line between ""it's part of the culture"" and inappropriate; the last time Gonzales saw that line, he was still living in Peru. Any time work by a female poet is read, Gonzalez lectures on how mysterious/delicate women are, and how they truly have all the power. Otherwise, he speaks mostly English in class and grades arbitrarily.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department
 FWS010,5.0,2.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,If you go to his office hours he will make sure to give you extra time and help you out as much as he can with precision. His lectures are very interesting and his class is very organised. I would take him again and again because he is so helpful and open minded and encouraging. Take him if you can. His papers are very short too. Students love him,Thomas Schur ,Literature department
 RLST055,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,,No,Gilbert is a great person and professor. He is passionate about the subject. But he rushes through many topics to cover everything he wants to cover. The tests are also difficult and are graded fairly rough for a GE course. It's as if he expects non-majors to take a significant amount of time from other major courses to prep for his class.,Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department

 FHS10,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I love Professor Valenza; he is unusually kind and emotionally supportive. I go to his office hours just to talk about life. His FHS class focuses on creative expression and self-discovery, and his comments on essays are a page long and so wonderfully articulate/thoughtful. Class consists of video clips, music, and discussion. Always engaging!",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department
 PHYSICS33,4.0,3.0,,,,,"His style of teaching requires that you learn the material through HW problems.  What he does during the class period is reinforce your knowledge.  If you have a basic understanding going into the class, you get so much out of it. He shows you how to logically get through problems.  Helpful in offic",James Higdon ,Physics department

 HIS140,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,No,"I honestly don't understand how anything bad could be said about this prof.

 GOV20,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Busch is a great guy. His class is pretty interesting, yet has a tendency to get a tad boring at times.

 MATH031,1.0,3.0,Yes,No,A,Yes,"I would not recommend taking this class or this professor for your math GE. Unless you really, really, really love math (like REALLY love it), just take Calc 1.

 CIV10,3.5,3.0,,,,,Very goofy guy. During discussions he would stop for 2 SECONDS to see if we had any comments and launch into his own exposition. In retrospect the class was pretty easy and I got exactly what I thought I would get from Civ 10. Just enough.,James Nichols ,Government department
 ECON50,1.0,5.0,,,,No,I thought Professor Wright's Econ 50 class was terrible for several reasons: 1) He is too math based. There were more equations than concepts. 2) Exams were hard to study for and questions were random 3) He taught the class assuming we had already taken Econ before in high school even though it's an intro course. DON'T TAKE WRIGHT!!,Colin Wright ,Economics department
 LIT10,1.0,3.0,,,,,"She refused to teach, instead making us lead our own class discussions (but interrupting frequently, of course, to tell us we were wrong.)  Better hope you agree with her viewpoints.  Also, if you're a guy, try and stear clear - MANHATER",Ann Meyer ,Literature department

Very particular about Strunk & White.",Jay Martin ,Government department

I would take him again in a heartbeat if i had to take more math",Mario Martelli ,Mathematics department
 INTRO,1.0,4.0,,,,,"If the former entry is right, then I'm an idiot, too.  CC is here -and tenured - for one good reason: the autism center and her excellent work with it.

Not terribly hard if youve had some calc in high school, but math requirement is just annoying anyway and need a 5 on BC AP to pass out, which is, difficult.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department
 LIT10,3.0,3.0,,,,,"Bradley likes to talk about the fact that he went to Harvard... a lot. Like every day.  He plans his classes and lectures very carefully, so what students say in class rarely matters.  Fairly hard grader on papers, and classes can be very boring  Nice guy though",Adam Bradley ,Literature department
 FREN101,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,Very good teacher has recommended. It was through her ​​that I like to study and learn thank you very much for all,Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department
 PYSC109,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"The material is HARD in any class.  His examples and attempts to clarify concepts were very relevant.  I never really needed outside help, but I heard he wasn't as available as he might have been.  He seems a bit scattered and more like a student- he's not your typical stuffy, arrogant CMC prof.  Overall, I really liked him.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 WCRIS01CM,1.5,3.0,,,,Yes,Boring. Grades weird. All around just not worth it. Great for napping.,Kjell Lejon ,Government department
 SPAN33,4.5,2.0,,,,No,Awesome professor -- fun class -- you'll learn a lot without doing too much busywork,Maria Martinez ,Modern Languages department
 ECON50,3.0,4.0,,,,No,"I started out liking his class, but it eventually became a drag to attend. His jokes don't get any funnier and his lectures are hard to follow along. He doesn't lecture from the book and just talks; you have to pay very good attention to get good notes.",Graham Bird ,Economics department
 ECON50,1.0,4.0,,,,No,"First-year teacher, reads powerpoints every class and cannot answer most questions thoroughly or clearly, often just says look in the book. Tests are much harder than her teaching ability permits (average 23-point curve, sounds like a good thing but isn't). Has long, long HW assignments due on Fridays. Overall the worst teacher I've ever had.",Nzinga Broussard ,Economics department
 ECON196,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"If you are interested in econ, TAKE THIS CLASS. Best econ class ever. You learn a lot about real econ research, and all the new models for unempl, pricing, etc. Most applicable class to econ career except for time series forecasting with Weidenmier. Also, Shelton is very good at teaching/explaining. Spends lots of time answering questions.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department
 FWS,4.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Professor Kindley really values participation, and leads a great discussion. Although it's hard to get into a freshman seminar class, he made it as interesting as he could.

 ECON086,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Enjoyed the class very much.  Not sure what this ""ferocious"" stuff is.  Last semester his class of 30ish had like 10 As and 15 Bs if I remember right.  If you want easier classes go be a Psych major.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department
 GOV91,3.5,2.0,,,,,"My favorite professor ever. Maybe because the material was very interesting, and maybe because he graded me easily.  Just do the reading, and you'll be fine even if you go to class once a month.",Ralph Rossum ,Government department
 ECON101,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"A very organized professor who makes himself available for his students. Problem sets help you understand the material. Although, the book is not as useful, if you listen in class and do the homework, you will do well.",David Bjerk ,Economics department
 FHS10,2.0,1.0,,,,No,"Fucaloro may be good at chemistry, but he is the worst seminar leader. His class was mostly just him rambling about his own opinions and going off into random complicated chemistry problems. Not really an FHS class at all. On the plus side, he's hilarious and the class was super easy, you almost didn't even have to come and there's no homework.",Anthony Fucaloro ,Chemistry department
 FHS,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,No,"He is the worst teacher ever. He only accepts his own opinion and allows for no discussion in class he doesn't agree with.  He assigns 50 page readings and requires you to print out all of them, better stock up on ink and paper! All his class focuses on is Calvinism because he likes it. If you have him for FHs switch out. ",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 PSYCH096,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Professor Reed is very passionate about what she teaches. She makes the class fun and interactive. There is no final (it's only a midterm). Material is very interesting and easy to understand.,Catherine Reed ,Psychology department
 ECON8,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"He used powerpoints straight from the book's material, but explained things very well.  I got a C+ for other reasons, not because he's too hard for anything.  Love the turkish accent.  I recommend printing out the powerpoints before class and taking notes right on them; that really helped me when I started doing it later in the semester.",Serkan Ozbeklik ,Economics department
 ECON125,5.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,Professor Lincoln does a great job teaching his students the theory and applications of econometrics. He makes a very difficult subject interesting and very understandable. A great addition to the econ department.,William Lincoln ,Economics department
 GOVT20,3.0,3.0,,,,,"Nice prof, but lectures are really hard to sit through, and grade is based on midterm, essay, and final, which makes it hard to earn a good grade if you screw up once. Cracks jokes every once in a while, but they're not exactly the best.",Charles Kesler ,Government department
 MATH032,1.0,5.0,Yes,,,No,Simple the WORST! Talked about topology all the time! God I'm here to learn Calculus!,Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department

 ECON50,5.0,1.0,Yes,,,Yes,evans is definitely the bestlectures are super clear and hmexams are easy to handle if you review the lecture slides. Definitely take her as your intro prof. Can't even understand why there is someone thinking she is a bad prof...,Mary Evans ,Economics department
 GOV80,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,This class is a combination of stress and relaxation. The midterm and final were demanding (studying required) but we only had one short paper on top of the tests for the entire semester. Class readings are not too hard but you have to be ready for cold calls in class.,Giorgi Areshidze ,Government department
 FHS10,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Excellent and dedicated teacher. A fair grader and rewards students who work hard. Definitely take his class, I learned a lot in his class. His exams were fair too.",Daniel Michon ,Religion & Philosophy department
 GOV60,4.0,3.0,,,,,Interesting material if you're into the poli-sci thing.,Hilary Appel ,Government department
 HITCHFILM,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Morrison is fantastic. He expects well written papers but he practically spells out the information you need in class and on his prompt sheets. His classes will improve your writing abilities and deeply improve your knowledge of film and literature. Do the reading, take good notes and you'll be fine.",James Morrison ,Literature department
 ECON50,2.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Reteaches you out of assigned textbook reading. If you learn well like that, great. If not, you're going to be teaching yourself the material.",Saman Olfati ,Economics department
 PHYS33,1.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"It doesn't matter how much you love physics, if you take his class he will take that love and feed it to his horses. He is a mean man and a bad prof. He makes me sad.",James Wells ,Physics department
 HIST149,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Professor Selig is awesome.  She's warm and funny and easily approachable. She's passionate about the material and helps her students to be as well. The assigned readings for the most part are fascinating.  And I love her teaching style - very down to earth. She's definitely one of the coolest professors I've come across at the Claremont Colleges.,Diana Selig ,History department
 ECON102,1.0,5.0,,,,,"I had a hard time with Burdekin.  As a visual learner, I learn by taking notes.  He uses up/down arrows to indicate changes in economic indicators, and in a whirlwind he changes all the arrows without allowing note-takers time to copy it down.",Richard Burdekin ,Economics department
 PSYC126,2.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"She is very nice, and obviously passionate about her topic, but is a little inconsiderate about assignments, gives a paper assignment a week before it's due, based on the reading for the next week, so you're literally grappling to do a paper. Also, she assigns way too much reading that basically just say the same thing.",Tomoe Kanaya ,Psychology department
 ECON129,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Raviv is a great teacher. He is willing to go over any concepts or work you don't understand. His homework can be difficult but that is help you learn and prepare you for tests. He was also a great teacher for Game Theory.,Yaron Raviv ,Economics department
 HIST101,4.5,5.0,,,,Yes,Bjornlie really wants to see students succeed. Wonderful in office hours. At least skim all of the readings because he will call on you even if your hand isn't raised. Generally really fun and interesting topics. Shows the show Rome sometimes too!,shane Bjornlie ,History department

 SPAN173,4.5,3.0,,,,,"A very sweet and interesting guy, like everyone said. I definately reccomend Latin American Cinema to all. It fills the Foreign Lit GE and is great if you want to work on your practical speaking skills rather than reading a ton. I'm a film major with just minimal Spanish and I got a ton out of it.",Salvador Velazco ,Modern Languages department
 PHIL101A,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Amazing! One of the best professors I've ever had. She inspired me to become a philosophy major. Prof. O. expects a lot from her students, but gives a lot in return. Don't take her ancient phil classes if you want to slack off.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 ID196,5.0,3.0,,,,,"Wonderful class, great books and the topics made me question and think about the subject matter.",Amy Kind ,Philosophy department
 FHS,4.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Great professor and super helpful during office hours. His class is a little confusing because he bounces around topics a lot. However, he gives out handouts every class that summarize what he is trying to say. These are great. Assigns responses to readings every class which are a bit of a pain but not too bad. Would definitely take his class!",James Kreines ,Philosophy department
 ECON50,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Hands down my favorite professor at CMC. His Econ 50 class is light on math but heavy on conceptual understanding, and he manages to make the material interesting. Super helpful in office hours. Highly recommend his classes.",Ricardo Fernholz ,Economics department
 PHIL030H,5.0,3.0,Yes,,A,No,"Locke is phenomenal. I took his Honors Philosophy class as a GE and loved it! Readings are short, and the class is almost completely discussion based after the first 2 weeks. You will LEARN how to write. If you go to office hours for your papers and learn from your mistakes, you will do well.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department
 SPAN044,5.0,2.0,Yes,,A,Yes,"Let me just say, I loved Altamirano's 44 class. She's an awesome (young) professor who can really relate to students. She knows what she's doing and is definitely there for you if you go into office hours. Altamirano makes the class fun and interesting for the students. Made me want to be a Spanish dualno one else can compare! Love her!",Nicole Altamirano ,Modern Languages department
 GOV20H,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"One of the most helpful teachers I have had, always willing to help and give guidance. Keeps course relevant to modern society and challenges students to improve their analytical and argumentative skills.",John J. Pitney ,Government department
 MATH131,3.5,5.0,,,,No,"Analysis is a hard class, and Aksoy is not an easy prof.  Her exams are difficult, as are her quizzes, and her problem sets take a lot of time (15 hrs/week average).  I did not do well in her class. That being said, she does care about her students and their success.  When I came in for help she did everything she could to be accommodating.",Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department
 GOV20,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"You must read, you must go to class, and in order to get what's going on, you should probably participate.  There is a whole lot of reading, and two papers (5 pg and 15 pg) that are required.   He knows what he's talking about and if you challenge him he might fling all of his degrees at you.  Overall he's a really great professor",Ken Miller ,Government department
 SPAN22,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Gonzales is a great guy! The class is so fun, and he really cares about the students. I recommend him to everyone taking Spanish at CMC.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department

 RLST055,5.0,3.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"Great lecturer, clearly extremely knowledgeable on the subjects of the class. Assigned readings are recommended but not necessarily required.

 FHS10,5.0,1.0,Yes,Yes,A,Yes,"Professor Valenza is amazing. His class changed my life. Sure, there is a bit of reading, but his FHS is like a giant therapy. It really helped me transition into the college life, and I still visit him from time to time.",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department
 PHYS33,3.5,2.0,,,,,"He is not terrible, the people who wrote that probably had fairly weak backgrounds in physics. It is very hard to learn the material in the course for the first time. However, most of it should be review, and the examples he provides in class should be enough to refresh your memory.",James Higdon ,Physics department
 PSYCH70,5.0,4.0,,,,,"One of the best professors at CMC. Great stories, really brings abnormal psych alive. He has high expectations but you know what to expect. Reasonable workload, hard tests. If you do well in his class, he'll take an interest in you and write recommendations.",Daniel Krauss ,Psychology department
 HIS140,4.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,,Yes,"She knows what she is talking about, and is student-centered. She will work around YOUR schedule (she will let you turn in papers late if you have midterms that week). Very flexible. That said she is quirky :), slightly disorganized, and tardy. But she makes up for it by bringing treats to class. Would highly recommend!",Lisa Cody ,History department
 GOV20,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Busch is an awesome guy. He is really into the subject that he teaches, and knows pretty much everything about American politics. Class can be a little slow sometimes, and class is just a reflection of the readings, so attendance isn't mandatory. Easy to get a B, impossible to get an A. Take his class though, I learned a lot!",Andrew Busch ,Government department
 MATH031,2.0,4.0,Yes,No,C+,Yes,"Nice professor and willing to help you in OH if you're struggling; however, that doesn't hide the fact that lecture is boring and tests are difficult. His study guides were 40+ textbook problems that only gave you a general sense, so you ended up memorizing than actually learning. People ended up taking an extra hour on the final b/c of the rigor.",Michael O'Neill ,Mathematics department
 ACCT2,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Very great professor, extremely helpful, makes sure all students understand material, office hours are always open, and always wants to help his students outside of class in finding internships or other opportunities",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department
 PSYC37,2.5,3.0,Yes,,B-,Yes,"Not sure about the good reviews below. Riggio was okay, a very average professor that I wouldn't mind taking again for a class I don't care for, but not a professor I would take again if I had another option. Boring class overall but it wasn't the hardest thing.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department
 GOV80,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,B+,No,"Great class with great readings.   This kind of course is why I went to college, but have rarely found.  Nadon will provoke you to think.  So stay away if you need to be left in your cocoon.  Tough but fair grading.",Christopher Nadon ,Government department
 FR120,5.0,4.0,,,,,"Prof. Shelton is very passionate and interesting, which made this class my favorite  of the semester.  If you have the opportunity to take from her, DO IT!!! She's a bit intimidating, but you'll find that's just because she's so intelligent.",Marie-Denise Shelton ,Modern Languages department
 CHEM15,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Best professor I have ever had. Not an exaggeration: he is literally the best. Excellent lecturer. Very receptive to student input. Relatively difficult subject, but he does everything he can to make the exams and homework completely fair. Plus, personally he is ridiculously nice and really cares about his students. Take his class!",Babak Sanii ,Chemistry department
 CIV10,1.0,4.0,,,,,"This guy may be smart but he's a loony-tune. Talks endlessly, never listens to a word edgewise, and acts out every nervous compulsive twitch in class while he's rambling.  Drove me right out of the room.",James Nichols ,Government department

 GOV20,4.5,2.0,,,,,"Best professor I've had at CMC to date. Highly knowledgeable, helpful, a good communicator, and a very kind person. You won't get nearly as much out of the course though w/o doing most of the readings. Lectures are chill, even funny at times. Office hours are great. Take him & you'll learn alot minus the stress & garbage assignments.",Jay Martin ,Government department
 PHILOFRELIG,3.5,3.0,,,,,"I often felt as though he was trying to be openminded, but was just failing at it.  It becomes clear eventually that he's a pretty conservative Christian and that just biases him too much.  He is pretty nice, though.",Stephen Davis ,Philosophy department
 MATH,5.0,4.0,,,,,"Funny, outgoing professor.  Makes class enjoyable.",Mario Martelli ,Mathematics department
 PSYCH30,2.0,1.0,,,,,"Professor CC is just plain CRAZY and weird, but her class is easy. I don't feel like I learned that much, but I got a good grade in the class and I enjoyed her lectures for sheer entertainment value (crazy people are funny).",Marjorie Charlop-Christy ,Psychology department
 GOV20,1.5,4.0,,,,,"It's pretty much all been covered, very smart, but very boring, and not a very good teacher to those who aren't as well-versed in gov.  If you know a lot about gov maybe he can illuminate some for you, but for causal students his lessons are convoluted and complex.",Charles Lofgren ,Political Science department
 CHEM116,3.0,4.0,,,,,He's an Ochem professor.  He means well but his teaching style just doesn't feel conducive to many students learning styles.  The lectures are more like tutorials.,Kersey Black ,Chemistry department
 ,4.0,5.0,,,,,,Edward Haley ,Government department
 MATH032,3.0,3.0,,,,No,"Reasonably good teacher if you pay attention, but he doesn't make the lectures very interesting, so that can be hard. Grades are based off of in-class quizzes and one take-home test, which can be problematic if you tend to make mistakes on tests. Then again, regular homework doesn't need to be turned in, so you can get away with not doing it.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department

 NEWASIA,4.5,2.0,,,,,"Class sessions were really boring but that was influenced by my disinterest in subject and the early hour course was taught; Professor is incredibly kind and cares about students; he is also passionate and knowledgeable about his field; write strong, well researched papers and class is an easy A",Arthur Rosenbaum ,History department

 Explanation easy to understand very well taken. This is the best teacher I had",Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department

 SPAN33,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,The best spanish teacher there is...anywhere.,Maria Martinez ,Modern Languages department
 ECON50,2.0,5.0,,,,No,"He's not the best teacher for those who want to be Econ majors. He is very organized with handouts, lecture outlines and problem sets, but does not work from the book but rather ""suggests"" we do the reading. There is not a lot of work assigned but don't let that fool you because you probably won't understand the material unless you do outside work.",Graham Bird ,Economics department
 ECON196,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Best class/one the best professors I've ever had. Very helpful with HW in office hours. Takes time to answer all questions in detail, going over concepts many times in different ways until they are clear. Cares that students learn more than grades. Very accessible/nice.

 ENGL,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,Great teacher!!! And super sharp editor.,Evan Kindley ,Literature department
 BIOL43,5.0,5.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"If you love biology, you will definitely learn a TON from Dr. Cohen. That said, if you want even a moderately easy class, don't take him.

 HIST100,3.5,4.0,,,,No,"Took a seminar class from him.  Very into the structure of writing.  Assigns very high level readings.  Invited class to his house for dinner. Talks about himself a lot, but it's mostly relevant.",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department
 ECON086,3.5,4.0,Yes,,B+,No,"This class was one of the most difficult classes, but also made me decide to become and Econ/Accounting major.

 ECON101,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Micro: His lectures are clear and he is very helpful during office hours. I would strongly recommend using a different texbook than the one he uses though(Varian), as it lacks examples and is very bland.

 CHEM14,4.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"really easy...u'll be dissapointed if you don't get him for chem14.  take him at all costs to ur schedule.  just understand material and u'll get an A, he'll basically give you the tests the day b4 class",Anthony Fucaloro ,Chemistry department

Take his class!!",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 PSYCH96,4.0,1.0,,,,No,"Prof reed is good- but very powerpoint heavy and sometimes it felt like she was teaching middle schoolers b/c the material was dumbed-down.

 ECON50,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Ozbeklik literally teaches right from the book, so attendance is not mandatory.  His finals are relatively easy, and there is barely any work assigned.

 GOVT20,4.5,3.0,,,,,"very easy to understand lectures (sometimes a little hard to sit through though), grade is based off of 2 tests and 1 paper though which makes it harder to do well but requires less work throughout the semester",Charles Kesler ,Government department
 MATH32,1.0,2.0,Yes,,,No,Terrible class. Worst class I have ever had at 5C. I personally am a big fan of mathematics but this course is so boring from the beginning to the end. He probably thought he was super cool but he's so lame. ,Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 GOV113,4.0,2.0,,,,,"Requires minimal reading and little class participation. The class is structured around Lynch talking for 3 hours. Grade is determined by 3 10 page papers - which are graded easily. Interesting class, but not particularly challenging.",Frederick Lynch ,Government department

 GOV20,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"If you want an introduction to government his class is not ideal. However, if you have an interest in closely examining government from a fresh and illuminating perspective his class is unparallelled.

 LIT131,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"He is a great professor, and definitely knows a lot about film history. He is a hard grader, but only because he wants you to learn about the topics in depth.

 PHYS033,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"He is not as bad as everyone makes him out to be! Yes, he yelled at the class a few times, BUT I'm not going to lie, our class can be very disrespectful and rude.

You get what you put in from this class.",James Wells ,Physics department
 HIST149,3.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Professor Selig talks very quickly because she is so passionate about what she teaches.  She tries to fit too much into each individual class and she spends a lot of time giving the class historical examples of things that we may or may not enjoy.  Examples include songs and film clips that at least make class manageable.,Diana Selig ,History department

 PHIL30,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"Favorite course and professor by far this semester! He chooses modern and stimulating topics like religion, robots, and happiness. He engages with students and facilitates class discussion. He is a hard grader, but he gives tons of feedback and he doesn't give too much homework. Highly recommended!",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department
 GOV20,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"She's amazing! She is very knowledgeable. I took her for gov 20 where she tends to lecture a lot, but i enjoyed it.

 LIT105,5.0,2.0,,,,No,"Rentz is an unbelievably wonderful professor. She's adorable, yes, but more importantly- she's a fantastic teacher. Sensible workload, fascinating and varied readings, lively class discussion. I want to be her when I grow up. It's a lit class but you also learn a ton of awesome medieval history. Super helpful outside of class,  funny, and sweet! A+",Ellen Rentz ,Literature department
 PHIL090H,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Professor Obdrzalek is helpful and entertaining.  She has high standards for her students. In order to receive an ""A"" in the class, students should take their papers to her during office hours to get her feedback.  Her expectations are high but they are clear.  Without question, she goes above beyond the requirements of her job.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 PHIL90H,2.5,2.0,,,,,I just don't like this class. I don't think she teaches philosophy very well. She's too concerned with definite facts and logic and not substance. And the papers topics are just plain horrible. And she doesn't facilitate discussion well.,Amy Kind ,Philosophy department
 FHS1,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"He was my favorite class for that semester.  His class discussions are challenging and that is where it pays off to pay attention, although you don't have to.  He has a good sense of humor and kept the class fun. The way he presents topics and talks about them often blew my mind about philosophy.  A great teacher to have.",James Kreines ,Philosophy department
 ECON50,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,Prof Fernholz is a super clear lecturer. He is great for Econ50 because he makes sure his students understand the material. He goes by the textbook and gives practice midterms.  I  would definitely recommend him for someone who has never taken Econ before (like me),Ricardo Fernholz ,Economics department
 PHIL38,4.0,4.0,,,,No,He is so wonderful! The class is a lot of very interesting discussion and he is willing to explain things until they make sense to everyone. The essays are tough but if you go to office hours and ask questions he is more than willing to help. By far my favorite professor.,Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department
 SPAN044,3.5,2.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,Great teacher makes subject material very interesting not a walk in the park though definitely need to put in the work to get the grade but her expectations are very clear.,Nicole Altamirano ,Modern Languages department
 GOV20,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"As far as Government professors goes, I would venture to say Pitney could very well be the best in the nation. It is a fact that he is ""the most quoted political science professor in the nation.""  If you ever listen to NPR news, he will most likely be quoted in it. Beyond that his teaching is amazing; he spends an absurd amount of time on students",John J. Pitney ,Government department
 MATH131,3.5,5.0,,,,No,"analysis is known to be one of the harder math classes and rightly so, as the material is dense and far-fetched. unless you're a hardcore theoretical math person, the material in this class seems useless and the class is painful. aksoy is a theoretical mathematician so she loves this stuff. the class is hard, but aksoy tries her best to help.",Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department
 GOV90,4.5,3.0,,,,No,"As a non-CMC student, I can say that I felt extremely comfortable in this class. He is a brilliantly clear and comprehensible lecturer and not partisan on any issues. Very highly recommended for people interested in the constitution.",Ken Miller ,Government department
 SPAN022,2.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"This guy's hilarious. Totally one of my favorite profs from last semester. His accent can be hard to understand at times, but get on his good side, and you'll have a great class. I'm really bummed I can't take more classes with this guy.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department
 FWS,4.0,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,Took him for FWS. Very little reading with 5 short essays (2-3 pages) and one final essay (8-10 pages). Really nice guy who was very helpful in class and during office hours. At times I was confused by his grading on certain assignments but I would definitely recommend his class,Thomas Schur ,Literature department
 RLST055,5.0,4.0,Yes,Yes,A+,Yes,"Really wonderful person and professor - very easy to contact and talk to during his office hours (he always brings up helpful questions to consider for research projects!) His tests are pretty hard and arduous to study for, and my only critique of his teaching is that I think he tries to cover too much material. Reading semi-required. also RLST163",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department
 ALL,5.0,1.0,,,,,"Excellent.  Extremely generous with his time in and out of class.  Students can learn much from this man.  A word to the wise (but especially the unwise, however): if you say stupid things, he will not feel shy about repudiating your stupidity.",Mark Blitz ,Government department
 FHS10,2.5,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Frustrating. Over-simplifies complex arguments and interesting readings. Picks on only few people to participate in class.  Wants you to ignore ""good academic and concise writing"" and instead be incoherent and organic. I lost all my writing skills after this class. Take this class if you like over-generalizations",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department
 PHYS33,3.0,3.0,,,,,"Depending on your backround physics, you'll either be well off in class or be clueless. Man has a strange sense of humor and has a chip on his shoulder half the time (not towards students tho).

 PSYCH70,5.0,3.0,,,,,"Great class, really interesting.  He is a great prof--really funny and lots of stories to tell.  The tests are kind of hard, but just make sure you know EVERYTHING on the review sheets.  He is not an easy prof, but it's hard to get a really bad grade.",Daniel Krauss ,Psychology department
 FHS010,3.5,3.0,,,B+,Yes,"She is extremely disorganized; I cannot emphasize that enough. We had to cancel several reading assignments and essays because of her disorganization, and she gave very little instruction as to how we should approach the essays and presentations. She is helpful if you can meet with her, but her hours are unpredictable. Nice lady, ineffective prof",Lisa Cody ,History department
 GOVT020,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Prof Busch is a very nice guy and he picks pretty good readings.  Class can be a little slow, but he tries to engage everyone in some discussion and overall, the material is relevant and interesting for most majors.  There are several short papers, a take home midterm, and a final.  You have to work pretty hard to get an A.",Andrew Busch ,Government department
 CALC30,3.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Nice professor and good with accommodations. Lectures pretty dry. Calc 1 with him is easy if you've had some calculus before, and he does not take attendance. Only grades were two midterms and the final all heavily curved, and 10% homework.",Michael O'Neill ,Mathematics department
 ECON86,4.0,5.0,,,,No,Made me want to become an Econ/Accounting major. His class is more than worth it.,Markos Massoud ,Accounting department
 PSYC37,1.0,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Class material itself wasn't hard but there was considerable work. Riggio makes you partner up to do what he calls RPT, which is making practice tests with answer keys for each other before each exam. You have to hand in your RPT stuff with your study sheet for the exam. Group project is also a lot of work.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department
 GOV80,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,B,Yes,"Boring class with only ""discussion"" day in and day out. Egotistical prof. Lots of reading in the class",Christopher Nadon ,Government department
 FREN44,4.5,3.0,,,,,"I don't remember Shelton being above-and-beyond-helpful as my freshman teacher, but when I've worked with her since then, she's always been MORE than happy to help. Turns out she's SUPER nice. I think I just didn't talk to her enough as a student. Give her a chance-- she's very knowledgeable.",Marie-Denise Shelton ,Modern Languages department
 CIV10GOV,4.0,3.0,,,,,"I took two classes from him.  I did much better in the second one.  He talks on and on, the readings are dull, but the discussion is hot.  Don't be afraid to speak your mind and engage him.  He is one of the smartest profs. we've got.",James Nichols ,Government department
 ECON101,3.0,3.0,,,,No,"Prof. Wright is a great professor and I learned a lot about micro from him. Being a Mudder, no one else in my class knew any real math so they thought it was hard, but the numerical approach to problems was realistic and easier for me to understand.",Colin Wright ,Economics department
 CIV10,3.0,3.0,,,A,,His class is fairly easy (1 page paper a week) until the end.  Then he smacks you with a 20 page final!,Jay Martin ,Government department

 PSYC90,4.0,1.0,,,,,"Anyone who bashes Intro to Psyche with Prof CC is an idiot.  She is a little wacky, and she might not care 100% about teaching, but she knows her stuff.  Her tests aren't that hard.  You'll get a good grade if you put in two hours of solid studying before the final and mid-term.  The projects are easy.  She wants you to get a good grade.  Take her.",Marjorie Charlop-Christy ,Psychology department
 POL1945,5.0,5.0,,,,,One of the most challenging classes I took at CMC but also the one in which I learned the most; Lofgren spent signifcant time helping me improve my writing and speaking style; helped me develop confidence and become a much stronger debater in class; totally fair even though my views opposed his,Charles Lofgren ,Political Science department
 USISRAELARABS,2.0,4.0,,,,,"His grading was absurd. He didn't get papers back to us for a long time and the simulation, while fun, didn't count for any of our grade. He wasn't even there for most of it. He's very particular for presentation and will make you start over if its not the way he wants it. You learn a lot, but you have to put up with his ****.",Edward Haley ,Government department
 MATH111,1.0,2.0,,,,No,"If you are good at plugging things into a calculator and memorizing things, this is the class for you! However, if you are legitimately good at math and interested in the subject, you will find yourself regretting your life decisions. The guy lists ""Linear Algebra using Graphing Calculators"" as a Research Interest. That should say it all...",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,4.5,3.0,,,,,Great prof for Econ 50.  His lectures and reveiw sessions really help.,Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department
 LIT10,5.0,4.0,,,,,"She's awesome!  She definitely keeps each student accountable for the reading.  Each student has to post in an online discussion on WebCT before each class.  At first I found this really annoying, but it keeps everyone reading.  This makes for some great discussions.  I highly recommend her class!!!",Audrey Bilger ,Literature department
 MATH30CALC1,4.0,2.0,,,,,"Standard, high-school class. If you know your calculus than it is an easy A. Boring lectures but fair grader and fair workload.",James Pinter-Lucke ,Mathematics department
 MATH31,5.0,2.0,,,,,"Peterson's great - never gives up until everyone understands, and takes time and care to answer questions. tests are easier than expected, and very helpful in office hours.  very very very nice and funny in a nerdy way. only bad thing: hw due every class is really annoying. better than most cmc math profs.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department
 FREN44,3.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"A pretty uninspired prof.  We didnt do any very interesting readings.  Class discussion was little to none and any discussions were pretty poorly facilitated.  For a French class, we barely had the chance to speak much.",Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department
 PSYC109,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,Very fair teacher. I ended up learning more than I thought I could. Like any good prof he expects you to put 100% into the class and not expect things to be done for you. If you're a lazy student you might find this frustrating.,Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 RLST153,2.0,1.0,,,,,"Prof Lejon is GREAT! his class is an easy A, and you can get away w/o doing most of the reading. he doesn't hand back papers which is annoying, but he's really, really nice & funny, a great guy. You get out of the class what  you choose to put into it.",Kjell Lejon ,Government department
 ECON50,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"His lectures are very clear and there is very little work throughout the semester. The midterm and final were hard, but he gets all of his questions from class notes.

He was tough on grading but he did it to make us better.,Joseph Cohen ,Biology department
 HIST180,5.0,4.0,,,,,"I am in love with this man! He's full of hilarious anecdotes (if you get him on a tangent, he'll go on and on...in a good way) and truly loves his work.

There are only several papers (7-8 pages) and a research paper (10-15 pages) at the end of the year.",Jonathan Petropoulos ,History department
 ECON86,3.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,Really loves accounting. Can be helpful in office hours. Big on group projects and problem sets. Make a lot of errors during lectures. Tries to be very personable. Tries to trick you a bit on the tests.,Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department

 ECON101,4.0,4.0,,,,No,"This is a decent class. The issue is the lack of practice students get with the material. If you are good at math, this class is simple. If you are okay at math, this class is decent. Textbook is terrible and if you want practice with the material, it would help to just buy a good textbook. The concepts are tough and he is generally theory-based",David Bjerk ,Economics department
 CHEM014,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,Fucaloro is AMAZING!! If you have the opportunity to have him as a teacher take it. He teaches you what you need to know not all the other unnecessary material. Short and to the point!!! I wish I had him for Chem 015 as well.,Anthony Fucaloro ,Chemistry department
 HIST137,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Took Religion, Politics, and Global Violence and he almost converted me to a Religious Studies major. I LOVED the class.

 PSYC30,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Reed is very nice and a lot of fun. She uses a lot of powerpoint. Also, very upfront about expectations for papers and exams. As long as you put in a basic amount of work, you'll do fine.",Catherine Reed ,Psychology department
 ECON50,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Three words: PIZZA AND PEPSI. He is a great man.  This subject is totally not my thing, so the extra credit assignment (read Freakonomics and write a report) TRULY helped especially since this is a CMC GE req.

 PHYS33,2.0,3.0,Yes,No,,Yes,"Does not go over the material in class, you have to read and take a reading quizzes before each class.

 FHS010,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Nice guy, wants to help his students, but tends to assign a lot of reading - know how to scan. Class is a good balance btw discussion and lecture - he has a great amt of background knowledge that supplements readings well. Essays, when graded, were fairly easy in my experience, but that was probably because this was an entry-level writing class.",shane Bjornlie ,History department
 PHIL33H,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Really enjoyed his class, Political Phil Honors. Super interesting class, interesting prof too! Learned how to write really good phil papers.  Hard grader, tough curve.

 LIT10,4.5,3.0,,,,,"This has been my best and favorite reading based class I've taken at CMC.  She keeps all of the students engaged and accountable for the material, which helped us get somewhere with class discussions.  I became a better writer in her class.",Audrey Bilger ,Literature department
 MATH30,2.0,4.0,,,,,"Quite possibly the worst professor I have encountered at the Claremont Colleges. He assigns way too much work and some of the homework problems are so ridiculously complicated, he can't even do them himself.he was helpful during office hours, though.",James Pinter-Lucke ,Mathematics department
 NONE,3.5,3.0,,,,,"Didn't have him as a prof but he's my advisor and he's a great guy. Very nice, very helpful",Arthur Rosenbaum ,History department
 MATH030,1.0,4.0,,,,,"Easily the worst teacher - in the world.  Absurd and completely unhelpful homework assigned every class period, expected to take 2 hours.  She is a complete jerk - I took this class in high school and understood less after taking this course.  Math30 is a requirement but taking prof peterson is not - avoid at all costs.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department
 FREN44,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Okay professor, she's kind of hard to get to know outside of class and she seems distant. Very helpful in office hours though, workload is light and not that hard, tough on grading but allows you to write drafts of papers first. You'll do well in class if you put in the effort",Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department
 PSYC109,2.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"apparently much improved from last time, but has trouble understanding questions. teaches advanced topics that are not on the test (he just thinks they're important to know). do the reading if you haven't taken stats before, otherwise skim. workload is reasonable.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 RLST153,1.5,2.0,,,,,"This class was an easy grade though I learned almost nothing. He does not teach. It is a big free-for-all with your most outspoken classmates dominating everything. Like previously stated, he does not grade assignments.",Kjell Lejon ,Government department
 ECON50,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Great prof! I really like him and his teaching style. Granted having 75% of your grade resting on one test is incredibly stressful. There is little to no work in this class all semester long. If you understand what's going on and review your notes, the tests are no problem. He is theory based.",Graham Bird ,Economics department
 ECON102,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Best professor I have had at CMC hands down. Useful lectures and open to questions from students, and he never makes you feel stupid for asking a question. Problem sets and Exams are fairly difficult, but you learn a lot and he is very helpful in office hours. Great guy and great class.",Cameron Shelton ,Economics department
 FWS,2.0,3.0,,,,No,This class does not improve your writing at all. I learned more in my 45 minute sessions at the writing center than I learned in his class all semester. He's a boring teacher and unhelpful at his office hours.,Evan Kindley ,Literature department
 BIOL043,3.5,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"To say the least, Prof Cohen has a very interesting teaching style. He drastically changed his course based on student feedback so the class went from being very difficult to manageable.

 CHEM121,3.5,1.0,,,,No,"Easiest class I've had. Great lectures! The hw was a bit hard, but the take home tests weren't bad at all. Just write down what he says in lecture word for word.

 RLST166B,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Religion, Politics, and Global Violence was hands down my favorite class of my senior year. Prof. Espinosa did an amazing job of selecting the readings, I found them very interesting and valuable to my understanding of the topic. He was always available outside of class and very helpful on papers and other projects. I definitely recommend the class",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 PHYS138,4.0,1.0,,,,No,"She was an easy teacher although we had to write up things every week in the class.

 ECON50,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Tough subject for me, but Ozbeklik really does work hard to help you understand the material.

 MATH55,3.5,2.0,Yes,,,No,"Although lectures were cryptic and I was honestly confused so many times throughout the semester, he was incredibly helpful. The exams are really easy and test only surface-level stuff; if you study his notes before them, you can do very well even if you generally don't attend class. If you want to properly hear his lectures, try to sit in front.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 50,4.5,3.0,Yes,,B+,Yes,"Professor Evans is an extremely good professor. Her lecture notes are crystal clear and posted everyday before class, she is very organized.

 HIST81,5.0,2.0,,,,,"Selig is the best. She is so cute, knowledgeable, and draws you into the subject like none other. Very helpful in office hours. History 81 is the best survey class ever if you want American history. Best recommendations...take her!!!",Diana Selig ,History department

 ECON120,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"Raviv is great. He has been one of my favorite professors here. He tells you the first day, if you are willing to work hard in this class, then you will do well. It's true. He's very friendly and helpful. I recommend!",Yaron Raviv ,Economics department
 HIST103,5.0,5.0,,,,No,"Bjornlie is such a nice guy. He goes out of his way to help you with anything, and really cares about his students. He assigns tons of reading, all of which is good, but you will be graded on some of it. Papers are seldom, but graded fairly hard",shane Bjornlie ,History department
 PHIL033,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"I took his political philosophy class, which was really interesting. It is a good foundation for thinking and writing in a rational way, and actually helped me with my papers for other classes. The class is based on two papers, so if that will stress you out, don't take the class. Also, the grading can seem sort of arbitrary and he's a hard grader.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department
 GOVT145,2.0,4.0,,,,No,"Nice lady, awful professor. Gives middle-school level assignments and changes her expectations constantly, so can never give her what she wants. Grading is random and absurd. Won't admit when she's wrong. All you learn about is the levels of analysis- security studies was like an awful intro to IR class. Don't take!",Jennifer Taw ,Government department
 LIT10,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Really great professor, excellent at leading class discussion.  Though a little more tough on grading than most professors, if you take his comments to heart, you will see an improvement in your grades.",Seth Lobis ,Literature department

 PHIL90H,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"My favorite class in my first semester.  There's great class discussion.  I've had the most contact with Prof. O out of all my professors: she has lunches with us, meets us to look at outlines for essays, or makes time to meet if we don't understand something.  The class is a lot of fun.  I've learned to build strong arguments.  Yay for philosophy!",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 PHIL90H,4.0,4.0,,,,,"Excellent balance of discussion and lecture.  If the students are into the class, it will be very interesting.  A normal amount of reading and paper writing.  Grades decently but definitely does not hand out easy ""A""s.",Amy Kind ,Philosophy department
 PHIL101,4.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Although I had not noticed while sitting in his class, early modern has changed the way I look at the world and has challenged the foundations of everything from knowledge to causality. I highly recommend Krienes. He will make you a better writer and a better arguer, though it comes with the cost of a challenging class and a tough grading system.",James Kreines ,Philosophy department
 ECON102,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,Fernholz is the man! He keeps math simple (great for IR majors who need macro). He is super helpful in office hours with problem sets and before exams. Workload is totally manageable and realistic. Take Macro with this guy!,Ricardo Fernholz ,Economics department
 PHIL30H,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Locke is one of my favorite teachers at CMC. He tried out a funky grading style on our class which required a lot of work, but my writing has improved exponentially as a result. He'll talk you through the entire paper if you're having trouble writing it too.  He's great in class too, he's funny and brilliant. Highly recommend!",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department
 SPAN33,5.0,2.0,,,A,Yes,"She is awesome! Very helpful, assigns a reasonable amount of work, and spends a lot of time on actual skills such as speaking and listening. Take her Spanish 33 class, you learn a to without it being too hard.",Nicole Altamirano ,Modern Languages department
 GOVH20,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"This guy is absolutely amazing. I've never been so excited about going to class before. This class gave me a much better understanding of how America works.

TAKE THIS PROF BEFORE YOU GRADUATE!!!!",John J. Pitney ,Government department
 MATH32,1.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"I used to be in love with math. Aksoy ruined it all for me. She is so hard to understand, and she assigns a ridiculous amount of work.

 GOV91,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Great Professor AND Teacher. Really knows what he's talking about, and knows how to deal with confusion.

A must if you are a Gov major.",Ken Miller ,Government department
 SPAN33,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"unless youre interested in being taught by a guy who's less intelligible than ozzie guillen, taking this class is a waste of your time and money. flatly refuses to post anything on sakai even though he inundates you with handouts and other various junk.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department
 FWS,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Very helpful outside of class, and a good discussion leader. Workload is light - only 3 decent papers, participation, and another assignment.

 RLST055,5.0,4.0,Yes,,A-,Yes,"I love him and his class, definitely would like to take another class with him. The first 2-3 weeks of class were filled with boring powerpoint lectures that covered huge amounts of material, but don't get discouraged! After that, it's more lecture and discussion and it's so interesting! The class dynamic he creates is what makes it so great.",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department

 MATH030,4.0,2.0,Yes,,,Yes,Professor Valenza was my first professor at CMC and he was amazing. As a freshman I was in a class of 60 and though I would go unnoticed. Absolutely not!

A lot of reading but if you commit the time, you get so much out of it!",Lisa Cody ,History department
 GOV20,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Great professor. Extremely intelligent, and tries to engage the class in discussion. Tells government-y jokes and tries to make class as interesting as possible. Assigns 8 papers in a semester (which means almost weekly) but they're only a page or two long so not that big of a deal. The midterm is a take home written midterm. Would recommend.",Andrew Busch ,Government department

 ECON86,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"Despite the great reviews, I think Massoud sucks. Can't understand his accent or read his writing, he plays favorites, rewards people simply for stroking his massive ego, encourages people to ask questions, only to openly criticize questions he thinks are dumb, and doesn't actually listen to students' questions...I could go on but I don't have room",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department
 PSYC37,3.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"two midterms, one final, one group project composed of a group paper and a group presentation. if you're looking for an easy A you're better off taking the same class offered by a different professor. riggio is nitpicky when grading the exams/project and his rubrics are unclear.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department
 GOV80,4.5,3.0,,,,No,"The classes are all discussion based, but this makes for great classes considering it's Nadon. He knows where he is going in every one of his lessons and he isn't afraid to venture into uneasy topics to get there. No matter what the subject though, he always brings in humor to ease tensions. I'd completely recommend if you like engaging discussion!",Christopher Nadon ,Government department

 ECON101,4.5,2.0,,,,No,"He seems really hard but once you get used to his style of teaching, you learn sooo much. At times he is unintentionally intimidating but hes a nice guy really. He really knows his stuff and teaches Econ in a way it makes us think unlike other Econ teachers who use no math and just expect you to puke out defntions on the test. Best forthe long run",Colin Wright ,Economics department

Will look out for you forever if he likes you. Might just plan out your life, and get you a job.",Edward Haley ,Government department
 MATH30,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Absolutely awful professor.  If you don't know the material going in, he's not going to teach it to you.  Class is not worth going to, you might as well sit in your dorm and read the book (which he wrote and simply transcribes onto the board).  On tests you get a note card, which insures you learn nothing. Take someone else.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,3.5,2.0,,,,,If you have to take econ 50 Weidenmier is probably easier than most of the other profs.  He gives you printouts of his power point lectures and practice tests for the midterms and final.  He also tries to be funny too.,Marc Weidenmier ,Economics department

 PSYCH110,2.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"I took Cook for both Stats and Research Methods and found him fair.  He was only following the standards that Stats. and Methods profs. established before him.

They're just tough classes with ANY prof.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 RS37,1.5,3.0,,,,,"Ok this man doesn't know what day it is. All he talks about is how great Sweeden is and how much he wished US students were like they are 'back home'... please.

 ECON50,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Bird is a visiting professor from England, so his teaching style is very much British.

He's very approachable and explains things very clearly, and the midterm and final are not too difficult.",Graham Bird ,Economics department
 FWS10,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Drop this class if at all possible. Why? Kindley expects you to give ridiculous interpretations of the novels read in class and gives no insight whatsoever. There is no reason to attend this class at all because all he does is ask students what they thought and stupidly comments ""interesting"" every time. His grading style is also ridiculous.",Evan Kindley ,Literature department

 ECON086,2.0,4.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,No,"Complicates accounting to the highest degree. Think it was impossible to be assigned a paper and be critiqued on writing ability in an accounting class?

It's not easier nor better than Massoud's class",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department

 GOV20,3.5,3.0,,,,No,Very nice teacher but i strongly recommend not taking this class. It is a ton of work and difficult to get a solid A. You wont get below a B+ but its not worth it.  Something like 20 or more papers. He knows what he is talking about and is very excited but lectures dont help on essays so they are kinda useless making it boring. Just not worth it,Andrew Busch ,Government department
 MATH031,3.0,2.0,Yes,Yes,A,No,"He's not a good lecturer and often makes mistakes in class. You have to really pay attention because the class is really dry. That being said, he produces practice exams for every exam and doesn't ask anything unfair or too different from what is on those. Attendance not mandatory at all, you will probably read the book to understand anyways.",Michael O'Neill ,Mathematics department
 ECON086,4.5,5.0,,,,No,"Massoud is a legendary professor at CMC, but he's not for everyone. He designs the course so that almost everyone fails the second midterm, but he always curves it out in the end, and if you go to his office hours a few times and work with him, it's very easy to get on his good side and make things easier. Be prepared to do a lot of work though.",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department
 PSYC37,2.0,4.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Professor Riggio was helpful outside of class though you don't need much help for this class (just read the textbook). His comments in class were often different from the textbook that he wrote, which was confusing. Not an amazing lecturer but does not ask for participation so it's all good. People just end up doing their own thing in class.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department
 GOV80,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,Really good teacher. Made difficult philosophical arguments accessible. Average amount of reading assigned and not a hard grader. Highly Recommended,Christopher Nadon ,Government department

 ECON101,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"If you take this prof you are making a huge mistake. Makes easy problems hard and hard problems impossible thru his own incompetence as a teacher. You will be dumbfounded trying to teach yourself because most of the material he makes up and you have to make sense of his scribbled notes, and he makes zero sense in class. Save yourself.",Colin Wright ,Economics department

 STATSPSYCH109,1.0,4.0,,,,,"He made us do all our homework from the book and then he tested us only on his own weird way of doing problems (not in the book). He is very confusing, and the only way I learned anything in that class was from reading the textbook.  He makes even the simplest concept seem difficult. He is a VERY frustrating professor! Don't take him!",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 RELSTUD153,2.5,2.0,,,,,"Lejon unforunately could speak a bit more clearly and give better class direction to what he wants to see in written work.  While I liked the readings and some discussions, he never hands any papers back.",Kjell Lejon ,Government department
 BIOL043,4.0,3.0,Yes,,B,Yes,"After the first exam didn't go well, he was extremely receptive to the troubles of his students.

 ECON086,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,I don't think I would've liked accounting/decided to be an Econ-Accounting major if it weren't for professor Ganguly. He's funny and extremely helpful both inside and outside of the classroom,Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department
 CHEM15,4.5,1.0,,,,,"Great guy.  By his own admission he teaches to the tests.  He is very organized and very easy to understand.  He will teach you everything you need to know.  I understood his class much better than my chem 14 with williams, but I like williams better than fuc.  Fuc is funny, but if you don't understand he is not very willing to help you, but its ez",Anthony Fucaloro ,Chemistry department
 FHS10,1.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"I took his Race: A History class and I love the topic and some readings, but discussions were literally regurgitating what the author said in the reading, which was extremely frustrating. but he is a smart & thoughtful guy when you talk to him during office hours. great personality, but i disagree wit his teaching methods. (talks too much too)",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department

 ECON50,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Very enthusiastic Econ 50 professor. Take this class if you want a good understanding of the basics of Economics. He will bend over backward to show you how to understand something, and is almost always available for help outside of class. He gives the quiz questions before the quizzes, and so if you do a little bit of work, you should do well.",Serkan Ozbeklik ,Economics department

 ECON120,2.5,5.0,,,,No,"He is without a doubt the hardest professor I have ever had to deal with.

 HIST101,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,I have taken several classes with Prof. Bjornlie and I really love his teaching style. A good combination of lecture and discussion. You must come prepared to class and put thought into your papers. Not all of his classes have tests.,shane Bjornlie ,History department
 PHIL1,4.0,5.0,,,,No,His class is the best I have taken at CMC. He is thought provoking and wants his students to explore the issues raised and to further understand their own beliefs and opinions. He produces good philosophers.,Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department

If you're able, take her!",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 LOGIC,5.0,3.0,,,,,"I thought I'd have an impossible time with this course, but Kind got me excited enough to want to *earn* the A. Kind has a great personality and kept an entirely procedural course rather entertaining.",Amy Kind ,Philosophy department
 ECON102,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,Fernholz is the boss. His teaching method is fairly consistent with the book he uses and tries to teach everything in context to the real world. He keeps the math simple which has its drawbacks but makes the class fairly easy.,Ricardo Fernholz ,Economics department
 PHIL136,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Professor Locke is an EXCELLENT professor - one of the best I've had at CMC. His classes are certainly difficult but worthwhile. He grades you hard throughout the semester to push you, but his final grades are very generous.

 SPAN44,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Great!,Nicole Altamirano ,Modern Languages department
 GOV20H,3.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"He is extremely knowledgable and I learned TONS from the class. Biggest bonos: for such an intelligent, successful person, he doesn't have a huge ego.

 MATH032,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,She is wonderful!,Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department
 CAPOL,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"Miller is the go-to guy on state/local gov. CA Politics is an excellent overview of the big issues facing CA, and is a must for those considering work in Sacramento (ask him about Capital Fellows). He's probably the most moderate faculty member and one of the easiest to approach. If you have trouble, go to office hours - he wants you to do well.",Ken Miller ,Government department
 SPAN148,4.5,1.0,,,,No,"At first this class seems boring.. but hang in there.  Prof. Gonzales is a caring and dedicated professor that wants his students to succeed - if you do well in his class, a good rec. letter will follow... as well as a much greater enjoyment of Spanish Literature.  NOTE: much of the handouts he gives are missable... just do the daily work and enjoy",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department
 RLST055,4.5,3.0,Yes,,,No,"Professor Gilbert is absolutely incredible. He is so knowledgeable and passionate about what he teaches.

I only used one of the textbooks once or twice for an essay.",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department
 GOVT80,3.5,5.0,,,,,"Not only does he expect you to read all 7 long political philosophy texts, he suggests that students reread them all before the final.  You should also be sure to attend every single day of boring lecture if you want to do well.",Mark Blitz ,Government department

 MATH060,2.0,5.0,Yes,No,,Yes,Prof. O'Niel is a very nice guy but he's the worst teacher I've had in my life. The lectures are extremely dry (drier than California 2016???) and can make you fall asleep within minutes. I ended up reading the math book and watching MIT videos to understand the class. Don't recommend him unless you are a math wiz  and can handle it. GO TO OFFICE H,Michael O'Neill ,Mathematics department
 ECON086,4.5,5.0,,,,No,"Massoud is a legend, and pretty much the reason I came to CMC. He's one of the hardest professors in the RDS but always fair, and you can go and talk to him about anything. The man has a memory unlike anyone I've ever met before. If you work hard and ask him for help, you can do decently well. Definitely  worth taking a class with him.",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department
 PSY37,1.0,4.0,Yes,,Not sure yet,Yes,The lectures were long and boring. No one was paying attention or even showing up to the class by the end of the semester. Exam questions ask about the tedious details that are not essential to the content and were hardly mentioned in class. Not a hard subject but the way Riggio teaches the class ruins it all.,Ron Riggio ,Psychology department
 FHS10,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,we read many books-quickly and had to write 6 3-5 pg papers. Class is only discussion and can be intimidating if you interpret the book different than him. nice guy willing to help if you have finals conflict.,Christopher Nadon ,Government department
 ECON50,1.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Wright is not a good teacher!  I really like econ, but he is not good at teaching it.  There is no homework that you have to turn in, but the tests are very hard.

I took tons of notes, I thought i understood all of it, but the tests raped me",Colin Wright ,Economics department

 GOV151,3.5,3.0,,,,,"Amazing guy! As a prof and advisor. Get to know him, go to his office, take him to lunch in collins (he loves that). You'll be happy you did when you need a rec. Great class. So knowledgeable and really cares about the topic. Sort of senile, assigned a surprise 20-page paper once, but then gave no final. Listen and learn, he's so great!",Edward Haley ,Government department
 MATH111,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,awesome!,Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 MATH30,3.0,2.0,,,,,"If you've taken calculus before, you will do fine in this class.  If not, steer clear.  She can be difficult to understand if you don't have some sort of calc base already.

She's pretty nice too.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department
 FRENCH33,4.0,3.0,,,,,"I really loved her class, she is adorable!  she will answer any questions you have, but she can be unclear at times.

She really cares about her students, and classes were fun.",Fazia Aitel ,Modern Languages department
 ,1.0,4.0,,,,,,Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 RLST153,2.0,3.0,,,,,It seems like he doesn't understand the American education system.  He never grades assignments or gives any indication of grades.  He also does not structure the course in any discernible manner and leaves most of the teaching up to the students.  Also important: he takes his military background seriously; don't show up late.,Kjell Lejon ,Government department
 ECON151,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Very useful class.  If you're into starting your small business, you will love it.  Concepts are hard, the textbook is way too unnecessarily hard to follow, but becomes clearer if you follow class. Don't take it in your last semester, because the last week gets hectic.  My one complaint is that he could be more accomodating of graduating seniors.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department

 PHIL165,2.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Don't take his classes.  He gets stuck on a few arguments and doesn't even really cover them that well.  Also an insane grader.  He says no page limit, but really he wants 20 or more double spaced.  You won't benefit and most likely it'll hurt your GPA.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department
 LIT100,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,I LOVE WARNER! He is so engaging in discussions and lectures and makes literary theory which could be extremely boring actually really interesting!  He acts out authors accents like Freud and it's pretty funny.  He is ALWAYS willing to help you and discuss presentations and essay topics for hours in his office.  He is one of my favorite professors!,Nicholas Warner ,Literature department

 PHIL136,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. Locke is great. He is a terrific philosophy teacher -- he really cares that you learn and that you understand what's going on. His ""coach"" attitude towards philosophy is helpful for non-majors. He's funny and acerbic, which makes classes fun.

 SPAN101,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Altamirano is AWESOME. She is very interested in the topic. She takes class feedback really seriously and is always improving her syllabus.

 GOV20H,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"Class was a bit intimidating at first since he calls on you randomly, but you get accustomed to it after a while.

 SPAN33,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"Spanish 33 was an easy class, but he's not a very good teacher. He doesn't explain a lot of things very well, but the workload is relatively light and the tests are super easy. A few projects, but he gives you ridiculous amounts of time in which to do them. I recommend this professor for span33.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department
 RLST136,3.0,3.0,Yes,,,No,"While Prof. Gilbert is very knowledgable in his area and is obviously very intelligent, his assignments can be vague while looking straightforward in disguise. Getting an A is not as easy as it seems. There are lots of readings but he goes over the material in his lectures. He also talks a lot so the class is like 80% lecture 20% discussion. ",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department
 GOV020,2.0,2.0,,,,,"very, very boring, he knows his stuff, but if you can sit through his class, youre a stronger person than I, his voice is a v. annoying monotone. He also has a tendency to clutch, or lean against, or otherwise grope his podium.",Mark Blitz ,Government department
 MATH030,3.5,1.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Valenza is a total sweetheart. He never wants anyone to feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed.

 HIST150E,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,Amazing teacher who makes you fall in love with the subject!  She is always there to help and expects you to make an effort. All this results in you becoming a better writer while having fun.  She made me want to become a history major.,Lisa Cody ,History department

 PSYC037,1.0,3.0,Yes,,,Yes,"Riggio was not helpful in or out of class. His grading was very unclear and subjective.

Definitely do not recommend.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department
 FHS05,3.5,3.0,,,,No,"Good prof and interesting man. Class consisted of a seminar-style discussion of the readings which ranged from Homer to Jane Austin.

However, overall he is a good prof and nice guy.",Christopher Nadon ,Government department
 ECON101,4.0,4.0,,,,No,"Wright's micro, though harder than other micro classes around, is more fun. There's no homework, so three tests decide your grade.

 USCONG,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Like Prof Massoud, Prof. Pitney is one of the institutions that make CMC what it is. If you are a Gov major, you must take his class. US Congress is one of the most fun classes, and will teach you the nuts and bolts of how politics works. He may seem stiff one-on-one the first time you meet, but he warms up and would do anything for his students",John J. Pitney ,Government department
 MATH60,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"aksoy is hard but fair. she assigns a ton of homework but it's usually helpful to learning. she gives a midterm or quiz every 2 weeks, so you don't fall behind. her quizzes and midterms are difficult, yet fair and straightforward. homeworks are graded very carefully, so be careful. she's the sweetest lady ever and always helpful. highly recommend!",Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department
 SUPREMECOURT,4.5,4.0,,,,,the supreme court simulation was straight righteous,Ken Miller ,Government department
 SPAN101,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Very helpful during office hours, slightly incomprehensible in class. Do *not* take this class if you place into it without having taken Spanish 44--bad idea.",Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department
 RLST055,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,Took it for GE but Prof Gilbert totally made want to be a RLST major! Class is lecture based but he raises interesting questions for you to think about. Workload is fair(2 8-page papers and 2 exams w/ study guide). He is super helpful if you go to his office hours to talk about paper or before midterms.,Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department
 GOV,2.5,5.0,,,,,Intro to political philosophy--holy **** this class is so hard.  had to work madness. plus the final is absolutely impossible.  must identify all these quotes etc.,Mark Blitz ,Government department
 CALC1,5.0,1.0,,,,Yes,"The best. Explains things so everyone understands. Tests are easy - no curveballs and you're prepared for them. Pace can be a bit slow, which is good or bad depending on what you expect. Also he is very personable and helpful. Highly recommended, especially if you want a lucid experience that your previous math teachers were never able to provide.",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department
 HIST186,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Really nice and approachable.  One of the best classes I've taken.,Lisa Cody ,History department
 GOV191,4.5,3.0,,,,,"Very very good lecturer.  A lot of the quality of the class depends on the participants, he likes to do discussion, but a lot relies on what students have read (if they have) he assigns a good amount of reading, fortunetely it's usually interesting.",Andrew Busch ,Government department
 31CALC2,1.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Awful, he messed up my GPA and didn't teach anything! The only kids that seemed to do well were the ones who had already taken Calc 2. If you have to take his class, take it pass/fail or be prepared to teach yourself everything.",Michael O'Neill ,Mathematics department
 ECON086,4.0,5.0,,,,No,Legend. For good reason. Take him,Markos Massoud ,Accounting department
 37,4.5,1.0,Yes,,,Yes,"This class was a lot of fun.  It wasn't difficult at all; I think this is mainly due to the subject matter.  That being said, I think it is super informative and important.  It's not the most difficult subject to grasp, but it is a lot of fun to learn, and I think it is one of the more helpful classes in terms of real world application.  ",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department
 GOV20,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"This guy is a great Prof who isn't that hard to do well in.  For tests he sends an email with 6 essay questions and says 2 will be the test.  You'll probably prep all 6 which makes you learn/review all the material that has been taught, and you get a good grade because you know the questions.  Lectures are great.  Overall excellent prof.",Christopher Nadon ,Government department
 ECON101,2.0,4.0,,,,No,"Perhaps not as bad as many people here say. There are only 3 graded assignments the whole semester. If you are unlucky enough to get him, go to class and study. Some people say if you get Wright, try again next semester, and that might be right if you aren't an econ person. Otherwise, you'll have a workless semester and a mediocre grade.",Colin Wright ,Economics department
 CALC32,1.5,5.0,,,,,Tough****.  Hard to understand him.  Explains concepts as if you're on his level.  He's too smart.,Mario Martelli ,Mathematics department
 MATH031,2.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Yes, he allows notecards, but doesn't really teach the material. Does too many problems on the board during class for my taste.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 CALC30,2.0,2.0,,,,,"You better have taken Calc before, because this lady  cannot teach. She's nice, but very very very nerdy and boring and confusing. IT also might be good NOT to take this class if you've had upper-level calc already...like I did. The easy-A is not worth the pain in class.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department
 COGPSYCH,1.5,4.0,,,,,the worst prof i have ever had.  very unorganized in terms of due dates so everything is pushed back until the final few weeks.  everyone failed the first test b/c he refuses to tell us what he wants from us.  never take a class from him.  i hope he is not here in the future.,Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 ECON86,3.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"Ganguly is a nice guy. He is articulate, loud, constantly repeating himself. However, I cannot begin to tell you how ridiculous this class is. Impossible for an intro class. Expects way way too much from everyone. Tests are ferociously hard and the term project will have you running in circles. NOT an intro professor. Intelligent at highest level.",Ananda Ganguly ,Economics department
 CHEM1216,5.0,3.0,,,,,"All in all, a great teacher!",Anthony Fucaloro ,Chemistry department
 FHS01,3.0,4.0,,,,No,"He is the kind of professor you either love or hate. He is a really nice guy and means well, however his class and teaching methods drove me crazy.",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 GOV20,3.0,2.0,,,,,"good professor, conservative of course.",Charles Kesler ,Government department
 MATH55,3.5,3.0,,,,No,"Prof Nelson lectures quietly, and when he's sure of what he's talking about, lectures are interesting. He seems an extremely intelligent mathematician, but often makes mistakes in his lectures, and gets flustered, which can be  confusing if the mistake is not as simple or apparent to the students. Very helpful in office hours. Take Discrete Math.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"An absolutely amazing professor. She is super concise and crystal clear in classes, great use of powerpoint presentations, and homework sets really help you in unerstanding whats up in class. A great professor to take for intro, especially at this school where it seems everyone is an econ major and those who aren't are expected to catch up - fast.",Mary Evans ,Economics department
 HIST100,3.5,4.0,,,,,"Very shifty grading.  Beware, she does not have grading standards, but reserves the right to establish them after the fact.",Diana Selig ,History department

 PHIL183,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"This professor changed the way I think about learning for the better. The skills you learn in his class will transfer over to all other disciplines. He is extremely helpful outside of class and genuinely cares about the learning experience for the student. Listen to him carefully, he is very wise and candid.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department
 LIT10,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,Reasons why I LOVE Warner: 1)Engaging discussions. 2)Makes the discussions interesting and funny by acting out the characters with their accents.3)he makes you a brilliant writer. 4)The class is all getting B's and above - not too bad. 5) His enthusiasm for literature is adorable. 6)Very helpfull. 7)His teaching is inspirational. seriously.,Nicholas Warner ,Literature department
 PHIL1,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"She teaches what is definitely the most difficult intro philosophy course on campus, but it is probably also the most rewarding.  She demands a lot from her students, but it is only because she really wants you to learn.  She is very helpful in office hours and is a fun person to talk to outside of class.  Not an easy grader, but a fair one.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 LOGIC,4.5,4.0,,,,,"She made this otherwise complex subject pretty easy and even interesting. Her class is what introduced me to Philosophy, and now I am majoring in it. That says a lot.",Amy Kind ,Philosophy department
 PHIL136,4.5,4.0,,,,No,Professor Locke is an amazing Professor.  It is true that he has high expectations but his goal is not to weed people out of his class.  He genuinely loos for the best in his students and helps you to understand your strengths as well.  He is also really entertaining.  I never missed class once because I would rather be there than not.,Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department
 SPAN101,4.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Super nice, tries to pick interesting readings-semester is split up into short works, poetry, then plays. Homework is basically mandatory-she collects it. Class follows the same schedule mostly of discussing the reading, getting questions she wants us to go over, then discussing. Really wants you learn, makes you feel comfortable askng questions.",Nicole Altamirano ,Modern Languages department
 GOV20,3.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"I am not interested in American Gov per se, but I liked gov 20. The strunk and white approach is too fundamentalist for me, but go to the writing ctr and you will be ok. does excellent imitations-his lectures were almost theatrical. Fair grader, and tries and largely succeeds to be fair politically even though he is definitely conservative.",John J. Pitney ,Government department
 MATH030,4.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Aksoy is a fair and helpful professor.  He class is among the more difficult of the Math 30 courses, but her knowledge of the subject makes up for it.  She assigns a fair amount of homework, but students do not need to study as much for her tests because they are constantly challenged by the homework.",Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department
 GOV20,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Appears dull at first, but grows on you. This knowledgeable government professor has been there, done that: DC semester while at Pomona College, State Senate fellow, Harvard grad school, lobbyist in Sacramento, etc. Very fair, passionate, helpful, laid back.",Ken Miller ,Government department
 RELST135,4.5,3.0,,,,No,"If it was at all possible, I would probably add a religious studies major to my degree because of Professor Gilbert. I wish I would have taken his class earlier!",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department
 GOV80,3.0,4.0,,,,,He's okay. Lot's of works covered. He lulls you into complacency by spending too much time on the Republic and then expects you to read over 30 chapters of Hobbes' Leviathan in a week later in the semester.,Mark Blitz ,Government department
 FHS,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Valenza is one of the best professors CMC has. I took his FHS course--best decision ever. Extraordinary teacher, interesting subject. TAKE THIS CLASS",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department

 REAGANCLASS,3.0,2.0,,,,,"He's the nicest guy and such an intelligent prof.  He obviously knows his stuff.  He makes the best puns/cheesy jokes (especially when Walter Mondale is involved).  The reading was very unnecessary for this class because his notes are so thorough.  His structure is awesome: take home midterm, research paper, take home final. He's the Best!",Andrew Busch ,Government department
 MATH111,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,He was the best math prof I ever had!  Go to office hours.,Michael O'Neill ,Mathematics department
 ECON86,3.5,5.0,,,,No,"A very dedicated professor, he will make accounting much clearer and more interesting than an average professor.  A lot of hype about this professor, but he lives up to most of it.  Would definitely recommend this guy.",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department

 GOV80,4.0,4.0,,,,No,"Great prof. Class is really interesting, combination of lecture and discussion based. Goes in-depth into readings. Usually a reasonable amount of work. 2 midterms, paper, and a final, but a fair grader.",Christopher Nadon ,Government department
 ECON50,2.5,4.0,,,,No,"Uses math exclusively to teach concepts.  I didn't put a whole lot of work in to the class, but I really studied for the last test and did well.  If you're willing to do outside work to study and are good with math, you'll do fine and learn some.  Funny, but digresses into material of 101.",Colin Wright ,Economics department
 MATH30,4.5,5.0,,,,,Math is a difficult subject and I would prefer not to take any.  He tries to make us understand why higher math is important.  I don't agree with him on that.   He is full of energy and tries to make math tolerable.  I must admit that he makes sense out of Calculus.  He is always willing to help.,Mario Martelli ,Mathematics department
 GV149151,4.0,4.0,,,,,Great prof if you're willing to work.  He will also give you the grade you deserve.,Edward Haley ,Government department
 MATH30,4.0,2.0,,,,No,"very realistic. you aren't required to do homework, but he gives you extra problems if you them. tests and quizzes are very straight-forward and he allows a note card. he doesn't try to trick you. just study the practice quizzes and you'll be fine.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 CALC30,3.0,3.0,,,,,"Peterson, though a very nice professor, isn't one I'd choose to teach me mathematics again. I felt her classes to be very unhelpful, sadly. So...nice professor, not the best teacher.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department
 PSYCHSTATS,2.0,4.0,,,,,"Agree with previous reviewer: impossible to ever know when stuff is due. He just mentions duedates in the last few minutes of class when you are already so bored from listening to him ramble the entire class. He loves his voice and he loves to be right and he loves to be in charge. Full of himself, and poorly organized class. So boring it hurts.",Gabriel Cook ,Psychology department
 CHEM15,5.0,3.0,,,,,Genuinely intelligent and helpful.  All lectures are very clear and the tests are fair.  Has a fun sense of humor too.,Anthony Fucaloro ,Chemistry department
 RLST166B,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"One of my all-time favorite professors, he is encouraging to every student with whom I have EVER seen him interact.  Will work with students tirelessly to help learning, this professor is an excellent resource and a true teacher.  He's great at converting students to RS majors and is concentrating on building up this program at the colleges.",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 GOV20,2.5,2.0,,,,,laughs at all his own jokes!,Charles Kesler ,Government department
 LIALG60,3.0,2.0,,,,No,"LINEAR ALGEBRA-I very rarely went to class. I did all the homework. I showed up for the tests and put one night of studying in before each test. And I received a flat B. He reads off is lecture notes in class and then posts them online which is very helpful, but that makes it really hard to go to class. Moderately Easy plus lax attendance policy :)",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"Very nice tacher. Uses applia online for homeworks, slideshows for class, and tests aren't too hard if study what was said in class. Good teacher overall",Mary Evans ,Economics department
 HIST81,4.0,2.0,,,,,"Talks fast, but its worth listening to",Diana Selig ,History department
 ECON120,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"prof raviv is boring and goes through material very fast. however, his powerpoint notes are very helpful and he curves generously on exams. he's a really nice guy, although he can be intimidating because he's so intense. if you're a math person, this class is not hard. if you're math challenged, it may be difficult. but overall, raviv is great.",Yaron Raviv ,Economics department
 PHIL92,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"Not a lot of busy work, but a lot of effort is expected from students. You probably will get a lower grade than you usually do, but the class will be a deep learning experience.",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department
 LIT10,5.0,5.0,,,,Yes,"Professor Warner is a captivating lecturer, very clear about the class and requirements, and really  makes it hard NOT to see him outside of class to help with your writing. He is indeed a tough grader but it's reasonably fair since he is upfront about raising the bar.",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department
 PHIL112,3.5,5.0,,,,Yes,"I think you either love her style or hate it.  I loved it.  I think that it is genuinly one of the best philosophy classes I have taken.  It is hard, but not overly time consuming.  I would strongly recommend her class for phil majors or people interested in philosophical analysis.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 PHIL30,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,I actually really enjoyed this class. I thought the discussions topics were extremely interesting and challenging. He is definitely a hard grader though but very willing to help during office hours. I took this class as a GE and I don't regret it at all.,Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department
 SPAN44,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,"Great prof! I've been taking Spanish for 7 years and none of my professors compare to her. Integrates movies, music, art, and other things with the literature so its not all just reading. She encourages students to talk in Spanish casually in class which really helps you learn. Shes also young and in touch with college kids which makes class  great",Nicole Altamirano ,Modern Languages department
 GOV20H,4.0,5.0,,,,No,"If you're not interested in gov, don't take this class. It's hard and time-consuming (lots of reading and papers). However, if you like Gov, you will probably love this class. Pitney is very engaging and knows his subject backwards and forwards. He can be a bit intimidating, but he's a lot of fun if you're interested in government.",John J. Pitney ,Government department
 MATH32,4.5,3.0,,,,Yes,"She is wonderful!!! As a high school student, I learned more from her than from my high school calculus teacher. She knows what she is doing.",Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department
 GOV20,4.5,4.0,,,,,"Bright young guy, does a great job of keeping the class both currently relevant and 100% comfortable for right and left views. The field research project is a **** without a car, but worth it. Fun debates. Tests are tough but he threw a sweet study party, cocoa, cookies and everything. Take him!",Ken Miller ,Government department
 SPAN33,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,work load high just like any span33 class but he grades really nice. tests are hard but he will basically give it to you in a pretest and will clarify it if you go to office hours-this really helped me. i would recommend him to anybody,Carlos Gonzales ,Modern Languages department
 RLST135,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Gary is one of the most thoughtful, kind, and measured people I have met, and despite the touchy subject that is Jerusalem, his goal was clear: to impart as complete and nuanced an understanding of the Holy City as possible. He's an OK lecturer, but nonetheless an extraordinary educator and discussion leader, and his grading is difficult but fair.",Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department
 GOV20,3.0,4.0,,,,,"If you enjoy teacher's reading straight from their notes and you copying those notes yourself, take him. Also, on midterms you have to quote and identify authors and their works, very very hard.",Mark Blitz ,Government department

 HIST110,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Terrific professor who's really interested in her subject and wants you to learn it well. Class discussions are good and she's really helpful with writing papers. Always tries to make class fun but uses movies too much,Lisa Cody ,History department
 GOV124,4.0,3.0,,,,,"there is only a midterm, final and one term paper. He assignes a ton of reading but there is no need to do it all",Andrew Busch ,Government department
 MATH30,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Awesome prof! Very knowledgeable and always willing to answer questions. Tests are hard. Doesn't care about homework and attendance very much. Generally your final grade determines your overall grade. Class might be dull for someone, because he does many proofs, but these proofs help you to understand maths a lot better",Michael O'Neill ,Mathematics department
 ECONACTG,5.0,4.0,,,,No,"Professor Massoud is a brilliant man! He knows all of his students and is there to help you succeed. He truly wants everyone to get an A, and it is possible if you work hard to understand the material. I really enjoyed his class and would take it again in a second. It's professors like him that give CMC the name that it deserves. TAKE HIS CLASS",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department
 PSYC37,4.0,1.0,,,C+,,"Tells lots of strange stories, but class time is actually rather helpful. I went to class and never really had to open my book. Pretty easy, though he can get a little nit-picky on the paper.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department
 GOV80,4.5,5.0,,,,Yes,I read the Apology and Crito in Civ 10 and found them uninteresting.  Nadon spent much more time on them and now I see why they're still read after all these years.  He knows the books .  A good class with good readings.,Christopher Nadon ,Government department
 ECON50,3.0,4.0,,,,No,"Everyday: ""This is kind of Econ101 stuff that you all won't understand, but I'm going to say it anyway...""  and he was right...we didn't understand.  I learned a lot ONLY because I went out and learned it ON MY OWN...",Colin Wright ,Economics department

 CALC30,3.0,4.0,,,,No,"i think he is more suited to teaching higher level math. he can be very confusing at times, and if you ask questions that he considers dumb then he can be very condescending. but it's really cool that he lets you use a note sheet on every test and quiz and gives you a solutions packet beforehand.",Gerald Bradley ,Mathematics department
 MATH031,4.5,2.0,,,,,"She has a great sense of humor and likes to enertain the class.  She throws around a lot of weird/random math jokes, but does a good job getting the material across.

 RLST37,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,I want to express my gratitude for the course on the History of World Christianity. I continue to be shocked by just how much I remember and how what I've learned continues to inform my life. This was one of the best courses I took in college.,Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 MATH31,3.5,4.0,,,,No,"Prof Sam is a great guy but his Calc II class is a lot harder than these ratings would have you believe.  HW and Quizzes were fine but exams were hard - mostly because you run out of time due to tedious algebra.  Sam also likes to give really easy example problems (like integrate x^2) and really difficult test problems, not cool.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 ECON50,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Had her for econ 50. The nicest teacher I've ever had. She cares about her students and wants you to learn and enjoy the subject. I would absolutely recommend her.,Mary Evans ,Economics department
 ECON120,3.0,2.0,,,,,Professor Raviv is boring as hell.  He has powerpoint presentations for each class and they are posted online.  There is no reason to attend class.

 LIT163,1.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"""Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.""  I was disappointed with his leadership class.  He claims to be a tough grader - but what that really means is 1 it isn't clear what he wants 2 the class is structured so it's hard to improve.  You only have one or two assignments of each type - so by the time you know what he wants, it's too late.",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department
 PHIL90,2.0,4.0,,,,No,"Talks very very fast. Bring your laptop to class if you wish to get anything out of your notes. Abrupt personality, sometimes even mean.

 PHIL30,1.5,5.0,,,,No,"Before taking his class I was considering majoring in PPE. After experiencing this class for 3 weeks, I was really turned off of Philosophy. His grading style is unreasonable, and he expects you to be top rate philosophers in everyday class discussion.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department
 SPAN044,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,Altamirano is such a kind and interesting professor. The workload was always reasonable and we wrote fewer essays than the other 44 sections.

 GOV20H,3.5,4.0,,,,No,"He is a very intelligent man with experience in the world of politics. As such, he often teaches by metaphor, so it might be hard to understand the points  he's making unless you think hrd about what he is saying.",John J. Pitney ,Government department

 MATH32H,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Prof. O'Neill is tough, but very helpful and definitely knows his stuff. Do not take his class if you don't like math; if you love it you'll probably really enjoy it, but be  prepared to WORK and go to office hours a lot. If you put in a reasonable amount of effort and ask for help when you need it, an A should not be far out of sight.",Michael O'Neill ,Mathematics department
 ECON86,2.0,4.0,,,,No,"Massoud cares, the kind of prof that made CMC famous. He is focused on teaching and you can call him on weekends. Do not expect to cake walk through this class.

 ORGPSYCH,5.0,1.0,,,,,"He's very clear and his book is a perfect complement to the class (helps make sense of notes!).  He's a nice guy and uses examples that are helpful and often interesting.  He wants the students to do well, and it shows.",Ron Riggio ,Psychology department

 CALC31,5.0,2.0,,,,,"Compared to most other professors, Peterson is paradise! She actually explains the material in class and is always open to questions.

Also very good in office hours.",Cheryl Peterson ,Mathematics department
 RLST90,2.5,5.0,,,,No,"Do not take his class! Absurd amounts of work and readings.  Tests are impossible. Early Saturday morning field trips.  Doesn't care about his students, completely unhelpful.

The class was fine, not particularly engaging, but I think it is the best econ 50 class available. I would definitely recommend taking her. She teaches using all powerpoint and class attendance is completely optional as well. Work load is reasonable.",Mary Evans ,Economics department
 STATS,3.5,5.0,,,A+,,"gl if you are stuck in this class.  I don't know how you are supposed to learn.  My friends in class taught me.  Hard hard struggle to pull a B.  You gotta know the stuff he gives examples for super well.  His lectures are very poor and so hard to follow / stay tuned.  Very very willing to help, but his explanations were circular and not helpful",Yaron Raviv ,Economics department

 LIT163,2.5,4.0,,,,No,"While I understand that Professor Warner is great in some of his other classes, he was only marginally good in Leadership in Lit. and Film. He didn't seem to understand it very well.  I think this is because leadership is his hobby, while the other classes that he teaches reflect his professional interests. Probably is good for other classes though",Nicholas Warner ,Literature department
 PHIL090,3.5,5.0,,,,No,"If you are taking Intro to Philo to just fulfill a GE, I'd look to another teacher. Her reading are very hard, her lectures are hard to follow, and she pushes the class way too hard. She also spends way too much time trying to argue against students and has on occasion as blantly put down a student for no reason.",Suzanne Obdrzalek ,Philosophy department
 PHIL30,1.0,5.0,,,,No,"Professor Locke is way too focused on weeding out the non philosophy majors. And because of this, he makes his class extremely difficult, nearly impossible, to do well in.Expectations are way too high!

 MATH30,3.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"If you are taking Calculus 1 (Math 30) for a general education requirement or simply the economics requirement, don't take this professor. She is one of the toughest professors and assigns a lot of homework. She doesn't like to grade on a curve either. I recommend you avoid her unless you love math intensely. She makes things harder than they are.",Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department

 MATH30,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,One of if not the best teachers at CMC. the most caring and nicest teacher. been teaching for a while so he knows how to teach calc. hw is not necessary to do and tests arent bad if you are good at math. Take him if you can,Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department
 HIST100,5.0,2.0,,,,Yes,Prof Cody is an excellent teacher.  Her Art and Politics class is amazing.  She has made me strongly consider becoming a history major.  She is very flexiable about deadlines and will help students tremendously with their papers.  Class discussions are fascinating and the books/films for the class are too.  She even cooked for us at her home!,Lisa Cody ,History department

 MATH31,3.5,5.0,,,,,"If you're good at math, take him.  If not, at least sit in on a lecture.  Watching him teach is the funniest thing in the world, and he laughs for no reason at random intervals.  Super Mario + Santa Claus = Mario Martelli.",Mario Martelli ,Mathematics department

DO NOT take any class by him.,Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 MATH60,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"Definitely one of the best professors I've had. His lectures may not make sense at first as he is fairly abstract, but utilizes enough examples to get one familiar with abstractions in math. Incredibly helpful and has been a resource beyond my enrollment in his class. Don't pass up a chance to take one of his classes.",Sam Nelson ,Mathematics department
 ECON171,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"I would recommend Prof. Evans for any class because of how clear, organized and helpful she is, but especially for environmental econ because of the optional (really) extra materials and readings she provided in an attempt to make the subject relevant. After four years, she is one of the most helpful, accessible and relevant profs I had. A JOY!",Mary Evans ,Economics department
 ECON120,4.0,3.0,,,,,"Wonderful professor, hard material. Thick Israeli accent, hard to understand. Lots of powerpoints, lectures will get dry. I learned most of the class from the books.

 PHIL30,2.0,5.0,,,,No,"Locke is the worst professor I've ever had at CMC.  He doesn't like to help students, and he will kick you out of office hours if he's sick of helping you.  The only reason I attended class was because 30% of the grade was based on participation... and because he's attractive.  Even still, I don't recommend his class to anyone.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department

 MATH333,5.0,3.0,,,,Yes,"Very helpful, clear lectures, well organized, and likable.",Asuman Aksoy ,Mathematics department
 RLST137,5.0,3.0,,,,No,Amazing professor. I have never been as inspired by a professor or by classes as much as I have been with Gary. He is passionate about the subjects and wants the students to do well. There is a lot of reading but you don't really need to do all of it to do well in his classes. Take a class with him if you ever have the chance!,Gary Gilbert ,Religious Studies department
 CALC1,5.0,3.0,,,,No,"Hands down, the BEST PROF I WILL EVER HAVE. I had him for FHS and Calc 1. Both of these classes literally changed my life. Refuse to take it with anyone else, and you won't regret it.",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department

 MATH32H,3.5,2.0,,,,Yes,"He occasionally loses the class in his lectures with his brilliance, but his willingness to run weekly nighttime study sessions to supplement his office hours makes the class more than reasonable. The midterms are completely outlined with emphasis on concepts rather than calculus or algebra tricks.",Michael O'Neill ,Mathematics department
 ECON86,4.5,4.0,,,,No,"great professor. hard material. you need to stay on track with his class, go everyday, and review your notes often. but, if you have ANY problems he will sit with you and make you understand. he is always willing to stay in his office and help with anything. really interested in students.",Markos Massoud ,Accounting department

 RLST136,5.0,5.0,,,,,"This man is the hardest and best professor I've had so far.  He will make you work more than you've ever worked before, but he makes it worth your while and fascinating. As long as you're not scared of shouldering a burden and getting the most of your college education, take a class with him, it's worth it.",Gaston Espinosa ,Religious Studies department
 MATH31,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"Prof Nelson is the best math instructor I have ever had, bar none. I was not planning on studying math beyond Calc 2, but Professor Nelson's course was so interesting that I would now major in math if I could still change majors.

 ECON120,2.5,4.0,,,,,"Very interested in his students learning.  Practices lectures to himself in his office! (haha)  Not good at keeping you updated on your score.  TOUGH EXAMS.

 PHIL92,5.0,3.0,,,,,"Racjzi is a great guy and very funny. He makes his classes interesting.  Not challenging enough yet, but his assignments will make you think. Go to office hours with him!  He's very accessible (even gives you his home phone number).",Alex Rajczi ,Philosophy department

 PHIL030,1.5,5.0,,,,No,"Professor Locke has unreasonable expectations.  This class is intentionally designed to weed out non-Philosophy majors, and it discourages those who are considering.

Don't take his class as a GE.",Dustin Locke ,Philosophy department
 SPAN33,4.5,2.0,,,,Yes,She is great. Class is so much fun and really unintimidating even if you are terrible at spanish.

I highly recomend her class.,Nicole Altamirano ,Modern Languages department
 GOV20H,4.5,4.0,,,,Yes,"You will sweat, get frusterated, and work your ass off at times. But you will learn so much. If you're looking for a teacher to let you sleep through class, don't pick pitney.

 RLST135,4.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"Gilbert has a great wealth of knowledge and experience in his field - he is superbly qualified.

 MATH030,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"I was fortunate enough to have Professor Valenza for both FHS and Calculus 1.

 GOV130,4.0,3.0,,,,,I didn't read a single book for his class and got by fine.

His lectures are interesting and he is funny in that goofy sort of way.,Andrew Busch ,Government department
 MATH151,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"he's definitely not one of the easy teachers, but he is really helpful during office hours and is very willing to work problems with students. If you work hard, it's not impossible to get good grades in his class/",Michael O'Neill ,Mathematics department
 ECON86,4.0,3.0,,,,,"He lives up to his reputation. It can be a hard class, but its a topic worth learning, especially from him. He's a great teacher, although his lectures can go all over the place.

 MATH32,5.0,3.0,,,,,"I thought he was a great professor.

 RELIGIPOLITICS,2.5,4.0,,,,,He may have killed my interest in religion and politics. He gives a lot of hard busy work that is extremely unhelpful toward increasing our understanding.

 MATH050,5.0,1.0,,,,No,"very nice and friendly guy! math has always been my least fav subject but he was super helpful in office hours.

 ECON50,5.0,4.0,,,,Yes,"One of the nicest profs I've had so far. Teaches lecture-style with powerpoint slides you can access on Sakai. Makes an effort to meet with students outside of class and make econ more relevant to life. I still hate econ, but love this prof.",Mary Evans ,Economics department

 GOV20,3.0,3.0,,,,,"Pitney is definitely one of the most-loved Profs at CMC, but be a little wary.  Felt like he catered to those who talked a lot in class just to show off random bits of knowledge (regardless of the quality or relevance of their questions/comments) and papers are graded on style more than content.  I still learned a lot, but wouldn't do it again.",John J. Pitney ,Government department

It was very weird",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department
 GOVT104,5.0,3.0,,,,,"Pitney is the best at CMC.  He is quick at responding to emails and makes lectures fun.  He expects a lot on papers, but his topics are interesting and he is more than willing to help students make revisions.  I will take him again.",John J. Pitney ,Government department
 CIV10,5.0,1.0,,,,,"Great guy, definitely the best civ prof.  His class is super easy and super fun.

 CIV10,5.0,1.0,,,,,"I LOVED Professor Valenza for Civ 10. He is a great prof and he made the Gen Ed really fun and interesting. I highly recommend Valenza if you can get him.

 CIV10,4.5,1.0,,,,,"Valenza is the bomb!!!! Is class is easy to the max, after the first couple of weeks it get monotonous, but its still easy. You sit there and talk about the big questions that have no answer, like what makes a good person. No midterm. Only 4, two page papers on you own topic. Aint nothin wrong w/ that!",Robert Valenza ,Mathematics department
 ,3.0,3.0,,,,,"I never had his class but I really want to have an opportunity to take his class before I graduate.  I heard his name on radio, TV, and newspapers almost EVERY DAY!!!   Very talented and knowledgeable professor, and a great asset to the school.",John J. Pitney ,Government department

 CIV10,5.0,2.0,,,,,"While Valenza is a great human being, I did not enjoy his Civ class.
